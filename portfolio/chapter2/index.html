         <p><p><em>’It is indeed a privilege to be engaged in such a work as this’</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>When Oscar Monrad died in April 1959 he finally relinquished his place on the Trust Board of the All Saints’ Children’s Home, a body to which he had first been appointed in 1916. Apart from two years in the late 1920s, when he was on an extended trip to Europe, he had faithfully served the Trust for over forty years. The story of Monrad’s service is not unusual in the life of the All Saints’ Children’s Home. There are other examples of long stretches of volunteer service to the Home. Remarkably children’s homes were, in general, administered entirely by volunteers, despite the fact that they were sometimes difficult and complex to run. This chapter explores the management of the All Saints’ Children’s Home, how the Boards were structured, who volunteered to be part of them and how they worked to manage the Home. There were two Boards, the Board of Control, which also served as the Trustees, commonly called the Men’s committee, and the Board of Management, usually called the Ladies’ Committee. There will be analysis of what kinds of people volunteered to be on both the Men’s and Ladies’ committees, focusing on demographics and looking at possible explanations as to their motivations. This will also cover whether the types of people who were on the Boards had anything in common with other contemporary church-based welfare groups, both within New Zealand and internationally. The relationships within each committee will be examined, as well as those between the two committees. As the Home was open over a time when the roles of women shifted within society, this chapter also considers how the changing roles and responsibilities of each board reflected these changes. The management of the Home reflected not only the shifting social conventions over the fifty-eight years it was open, but it also provides a window into what kinds of men and women volunteered their time for a child welfare organisation.</p>
<p>A proposal for how the All Saints’ Home should be managed was put forward at the first public meeting to discuss the opening of the Home on 26 September 1906. Rev. Harper suggested that it should be managed by a board or committee elected by subscribers and that it should contain the Vicar and two Churchwardens of All Saints’ ex-officio. At this meeting a provisional committee was set up to oversee the initial steps necessary for setting up the Home. This committee consisted of the Vicar, Churchwardens, W H Maclean, a local solicitor, and two women: Mrs Ethel Harper, the Vicar’s wife and Mrs Rosalie Young.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Mrs Young was the daughter of William Hearn, a noted scholar at the University of Melbourne and very active Anglican so it is possible that she had been exposed to child rescue type work in Melbourne.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> By 3 October 1906 the committee had drawn up rules and a constitution and brought them back to the subscribers. Under the constitution, the Home was a Trust, with the Trustees making up the Board of Control. The Board, as per Harper’s suggestion, was made up of the Vicar and Churchwardens and three men, to be elected by subscribers who gave more than ten shillings a year. The internal affairs of the Home were to be managed by a committee made up of the Vicar, the treasurer of the Board of Control, the president of the All Saints’ Ladies’ Guild and three women elected on the same basis as the men.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The latter committee was officially called the Board of Management, but was most often referred to as the Ladies’ Committee, despite having two male members. The Board of Control was most often referred to as the Trustees.</p>
<p>This pattern of the men handling the external matters of the Home, like legal, financial and governmental requirements, and the women handling the internal arrangements, like household supplies and children’s clothing, was a typical apportionment of duties. In her work on the Auckland Ladies’ Benevolent Society, Tennant noted a comparable structure, calling the role of the women hidden and noting that it was a model common in England.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Another charitable society with a similar arrangement was the Auckland branch of the Society for The Protection of Women and Children. However, within two years they found the complicated organisation of council, committees and executive unwieldy and combined into one controlling committee of both men and women, which was dominated by men.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The non-denominational Hawkes’ Bay Children’s Home had been set up in 1893 and run by a female committee. In 1907 this changed and the structure became similar to All Saints’, with an all-male Trusteeship. Morris Matthews notes that it was the impact of the Infant Life Protection Act and the incorporation of the Home under the Hospital and Charitable Institutions Act that caused this change. The two Acts meant that the Home needed more funding and faced more administration demands, jobs for which men were thought to be better suited.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The pattern of management that the All Saints’ Home followed was comparable to other Homes and charitable organisations set up at a similar time. There was a definite division between what was expected of men and of women who volunteered to run the Home.</p>
<p>During the life of the Home there was only one major change to the way the Boards were set up. In 1921 it was decided to elect more Trustees. This was most likely in response to the increased number of children in the Home and the plans to open a new Home in Foxton. At the 1921 Annual General Meeting the constitution was altered so that the Board would consist of thirteen members. The three ex-officio members remained, but the idea of vice-presidents was introduced. The Vicar of All Saints’, by virtue of his office, was to be the president and there would be four vice-presidents serving under him, two of whom were the churchwardens. Lastly there were a further eight spaces for members.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Nevertheless, it appears that rules and regulations were not updated until 1925. At that point eligibility for membership became more closely prescribed: a member had to be a subscriber and a member of the Church of England. There were also two places set aside for members of a local committee of management for any home set up in another Parish or Parochial District.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This referred to the Foxton Home which had been rebuilt as a permanent Home in 1924. Previously it had been a holiday home. The Vicar of Foxton, Rev. Walton, who had been elected to the Board in 1922, believed that the Foxton Home needed its own, local management. He was the main agitator for formalising the updated constitution.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The Foxton Home appears to have never had its own board or committee. There was discussion about forming one, including replicating the Ladies’ Committee, but at the 1927 Annual General Meeting Walton was still agitating for the appointment of a board for the Foxton Home.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Another change in 1925 was that the Ladies’ Committee was no longer recognised in the constitution. This meant that the members stopped being elected by subscribers, being appointed instead on an as-needed basis. Despite the closure of the Foxton Home in 1933 and the increasing demands on both committees, the management structure remained in place until the closure of the Home in 1964.</p>
<p>From the very beginning the management of All Saints’ Home relied on men being prepared to volunteer their time and skills. The initial structure of the Board of Trustees had three places for men who were prepared to volunteer, with the other three men serving because of the positions they held with in the All Saints’ Church. From 1921 the total places were extended to thirteen, ten elected and three ex-officio. The men who served on the board were not always volunteers - eighteen vicars of the various churches in and around Palmerston North spent time on the board - but for the purposes of the discussion that follows they have been excluded. This is because their service on the board can be seen as part of their job rather than a free gift of their time. There were periods when the only member of the clergy serving on the board was the Vicar of All Saints’ and others where the board contained up to four other clergymen. The latter was particularly noticeable in two periods, 1930-1947 and 1958-1964.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> It is possible that clergy were asked to fill the spaces on the Board when there were not enough volunteers to fill them. Clergy seemed to play a more important role on the Board during the Depression and Second World War period. In the Second World War the shortage of men in general meant that those still in New Zealand found themselves having to work more, and therefore had more constraints on their time as well as there being fewer men available to fill volunteer positions because of their departure overseas. Clergy paid a necessary role in the running of the Home, but as part of their job rather than strictly as volunteers.</p>
<p>The majority of men who served on the Board of Trustees gave of their time freely, some of them for a considerable period. Using newspaper reports and minutes of Annual General Meetings, it was possible to construct a list of the men who were Trustees and therefore on the Board of Control. Over the fifty-eight years the Board operated, seventy-four men spent time on it. The shortest period was one year, the longest forty-three. The most common length of time spent on the board was two years, but once a member had past the two-year mark, he was likely to stay, with the second most common length of time being seven years (Figure [ServiceCharts]). It is impossible to tell why men left or stayed on the board, but the mode of two years suggests that it took a while for the volunteers to ascertain how much commitment being on the Board required. It is probable that the first year was spent getting to understand the workings of the Board and Home, and the second realising that it required more time and energy than they could realistically give. The fact that most men who made it past the two-year mark went on to serve for a considerable time suggests that they were highly committed to the Home and this was the generally the model, with thirty-eight men - just over half - serving five years or more. The pattern appears to be that once someone had been on the Board for two years they were likely to commit to a long term of service.</p>
<p>[htbp]<embed src="Figures/ServiceCharts.pdf" title="fig:" width="438" /></p>
<p>The men on the Board came from many different occupational groups. However, when looked at as a whole there are some discernible patterns in the type of man that was likely to come on to the Board and stay. Using electoral rolls it was possible to find the occupation of sixty-eight men who served on the Board. The most common type of occupation was professional, in particular men who were accountants or bankers (Figure [OccupationGroups]). They probably dominated because their professional skills would have aided greatly with the running of the Home, which had considerable sums of money coming in and out. The other large occupational group was farmers, which can be partly explained by the rural nature of Palmerston North, particularly in the earlier years of the Home. Another factor that farmers and professionals shared is that they have more flexibility in their employment hours, both typically running their own businesses. This would have enabled them to arrange attendance at meetings and fulfil the duties given to them more easily than a wage worker. This also applied in the case of school teachers. Six teachers served on the Board. Apart from one, they were over sixty in the first year they served, suggesting that they were retired or nearing the end of their careers before they felt they had the time to volunteer. It is also possible that this type of public charity appealed to professional men as it was attached to an established church. Although the men on the Board came from a variety of different occupations, they were predominately professionals, particularly those which owned their own businesses.</p>
<p>There is another aspect to how and why men might come on to the Board. There were two qualifications: they had to be a member of the Church of England and they had to be subscribers of ten shillings or more. These two terms would have automatically meant that only a certain type of person would be eligible. It is widely accepted that although the Anglican Church was the default church for many New Zealanders, those who were regular attenders were more likely to be respectable middle class.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Since it is probable that Board members came from the regular church attenders, it is more likely that they would have middle-class professional jobs. The subscriber qualification meant they had to be prepared to give a minimum amount of money each year. How strictly this was held to is impossible to gauge because after the depression the accounts stopped distinguishing between subscriptions and donations. However, we can assume that by agreeing to go on the Board, a member was expected to give, if not in a monetary sense, certainly in kind. There are many examples of members’ businesses donating goods or services. One of the best examples of Board members giving in kind was H G Bagnall, an accountant, was the treasurer from 1925 to 1954, who used a clerk from his business to keep the Home’s accounts. One of the staff from the 1940s remembers that it was a man from Mr Bagnall’s office that brought the staff’s wages each week.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The fact that this kind of contribution was expected from Board members, coupled with the type of people who might be members of the Church of England, meant that it was far more likely that Board members would be professionals.</p>
<p>[htbp]<embed src="Figures/OccupationGroups.pdf" width="755" /></p>
<p>The age of the board members also provides insight into what kinds of men were likely to volunteer their time. It was possible to find the ages of sixty-six members, using online birth, death and marriage information and cemetery records. The average age of all Board members during the first year they served on the board was forty-eight, although the range went from twenty-two to seventy. The most common age for a man to begin service on the Board was between fifty to fifty-four (Figure [Ages]). This is probably because it is an age when men were established in their careers and had more resources and skills to offer charitable organisations. Their family commitments were also likely to be lighter. By examining the age at first year of service, it can also be seen that after World War Two the volunteers were getting older. The average age of men coming on to the Board after 1939 was sixty-three; in the 1940s and early 1950s most of the appointees were born between 1870-1889.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why the Board was ageing. There is a notable dip in the number of members born between 1890 and 1900.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This is the generation that was most affected by the First World War, so there may have been fewer men in this birth cohort available. However, it also appears that the Board struggled with generational renewal. In the mid 1950s there was an increase in new members born in the first decade of the twentieth century, but there was not a high turnover of members, meaning that as the established members aged the average age of the board increased: for the 1955 board it was sixty-six. It is difficult to know if this was caused by no new members coming forward or established members not relinquishing their place, as there was no record made of those who turned down places, only those who accepted. In general the men who volunteered to be on the All Saints’ Trust Board were over fifty and since they often remained for some time, this led to an ageing Board and little renewal.</p>
<p>Originally, the Ladies’ Committee was meant to contain two ex-officio positions. One was the Vicar’s wife, the other the president of the All Saints’ Ladies’ Guild. Very little information has survived about the All Saints’ Ladies’ Guild,<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> so it is difficult to tell if this was adhered to. From 1925 there were no rules about who or how many women might be on the Ladies’ Committee. Since membership of the committee was by invitation, it can be assumed that the women who served were Anglicans and had shown some interest in the work of the Home. It was possible to reconstruct who served on the Committee using Annual Reports and the surviving minutes of their meetings, which are from 1938 to 1962. The Ladies’ Committee was a similar size to the mens, but over the fifty-eight years the Home was open, fifty-five women served on the committee, including six Vicar’s wives, almost half the number of men who served on the Trust Board. The average length of service was twelve years and, unlike the men, there was not a typical length of service (Figure [ServiceCharts]). The lengths had a similar range to the men, one year to forty-two, but the women tended to stay much longer, although there were small blips at two and nine years,<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> which is comparable to the men, but they are not as noticeable. Possibly the pattern of service was different for the Ladies’ Committee because the kinds of women who were on the committee, mostly the wives of professionals, had fewer demands on their time. The women who served on the Ladies’ Committee tended to make a long-term commitment to being part of the running of the Home, much more so than the men who went on to the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>The age of the women on the Ladies’ Committee showed a similar pattern to that of the Trustees. It was possible, using the same tools as for the Trustees, to find the birthdates of forty-six committee members. The average age of a woman when she first came on to the committee was fifty-two, four years older than the men’s average. The most common age was lower than the men, at between forty-five and forty-nine, but this is balanced out by the fact that very few women joined the committee before forty (Figure [Ages]). This is probably explained by most of the women having children of their own. They were busy raising young families in their twenties and thirties, and found themselves with the time to volunteer when in their forties. Perhaps significantly, the youngest member to join, and the longest serving, Margaret Mansford, had no children.<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Like the Trustees, the Ladies’ Committee aged after World War Two, with the average age rising to fifty-eight. Because membership of the Committee was by invitation, approaches to new members were recorded in the minutes. From the mid-1950s there was difficultly in filling the spaces made vacant by retiring members. Several approaches were made to women by the Committee secretary, which were sometimes turned down. In 1958 five women were approached, only one of whom accepted.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Of the the thirteen women who joined the Committee in the last ten years the Home was open, six were born in the nineteenth century, suggesting that membership was more attractive to older women. Like the Trustees Committee, the Ladies’ Committee aged after the Second World War, the work seems to have become unattractive to the younger generation.</p>
<p>The composition of the Boards and committee were typical of those that ran children’s homes and similar organisations. In her study of the Dunedin branch of the Society for the Protection of Women and Children, Reid described the typical person attracted to involvement as middle aged and middle class.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Howe and Swain found that the women who ran the Methodist Homes they studied were representative of a stratum in society that considered charity work to be a social duty as well as a reflection of their own place in society.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The types of people who were prepared to serve the All Saints’ Children’s Home fall into both these groups. The Board and Committee were overwhelmingly middle aged and middle class, and, as Reid discovered with Dunedin Society for the Protection of Women and Children,<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> likely to be involved in other charities,<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> suggesting that they felt charity work was part of what they were expected to do. This argument is more often applied to women, and is sometimes given the term ‘lady benevolent’ or ‘do-good’ ladies. Certainly the women who had long and influential involvement with the Home were from the higher stratum of Palmerston North society<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and may have felt that being on the Committee came with their social place.</p>
<p>Another aspect as to why a certain type of woman served the Home is that these were women with available time. Some could afford servants and, as we have seen with the age analysis, most had families that were older when they first came on to the Committee. In pre-World War Two society, and to some extent after World War Two, it was socially unacceptable for married women to take paid employment and becoming involved in a charity, like a children’s home, was seen as a proper outlet for the their time and abilities.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The fact that the Ladies’ Committee aged after World War Two could be a reflection of the change occurring in society around the role of married women. Possibly the kinds of women who would have formerly gone on to the Committee were now joining the work force when their children were older, rather than doing voluntary work. This change could explain why the Committee experienced difficultly in attracting younger women during the last fifteen years of its life.</p>
<p>When looking at possible reasons for involvement in a charity, it is most often women’s motivations which are considered and this is reflected in the discussion above. A reasonable amount has been written about why women chose to volunteer their time but men’s volunteer groups are understudied.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The types of men who became involved with the Home had much in common with the women in terms of age and social status. Therefore we can assume that some of the ideas of public service and social status affected the men as well. One difference is that men generally had less time available than the women, although the occupation analysis showed that the men who were on the Board tended to be in occupations that offered them more flexibility, therefore they may have had more time to give. Another aspect that may have motivated men was a desire to be involved in public life. Some of the men who served on the Board were also in elected positions, For example, A.E. Mansford was Mayor of Palmerston North from 1931-1947 while P.S. Larcomb and L.I. Plimmer were both city councillors.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Being involved in a children’s home would not have hurt their image with the voters. However, it is impossible to tell if they saw volunteering as a way to public office or whether they were simply the kind of men who would become involved in public service and being a councillor or mayor was an extension of this. Although some of the incentives for men to volunteer were maybe different to those of women, there was considerable commonality between the age and social status of the men and women involved with the Home. This suggests that they may have shared some motivations.</p>
<p>However, there was another aspect to involvement with the All Saints’ Children’s Home. As already mentioned, one of the qualifications of Board and Committee members was that they be members of the Church of England. This suggests that the Christian virtues of service may have had bearing on why people became involved with the Home. In his examination of Christianity and charity, Prochaska notes that nineteenth-century Christianity saw charity work as inseparable from the Christian life. Personal service and sacrifice for public institutions were seen as an integral part of spiritual expression.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Prochaska argued that as the state became more involved in providIng social welfare the relationship between Christian spiritual life and public service weakened.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> This was a gradual and complex process that happened over the first half of the twentieth century. Brewis also proposed that the interwar period saw a shift in the reason people did voluntary service, from that of benevolence to that of personal growth.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> These two ideas suggest that those born and raised after the First World War may have had different motivations for volunteering. The focus had shifted from that of giving resources to those who had less, to that of personal fulfilment. Analysis of the age of volunteers shows that as the Home aged so did those involved in its running. Most of the people who gave their time were born in the nineteenth century and would have been steeped in the ideas that giving to those less fortunate was an integral part of a Christian life.</p>
<p>There were also personal connections between those on the Trust Board and the Ladies’ Committee which may have provided motivation. The fact that the people who served were drawn from a similar sector of society suggests that there may have been a social aspect to participating in the work of the Home. This may have been stronger for the Ladies’ Committee, where membership was by invitation, but it was probably a component of the Trust Board as well.</p>
<p>Service to the Home was also a family affair, with family connections both within the two groups and between them. Of the forty married women who served on the Ladies’ Committee, ten had husbands who served on the Trust Board, the best example being the Mansfords, whose combined service was eighty-one years. There were also two examples of mothers and daughters on the Ladies’ Committee and fathers and sons on the Trust Board. Caroline Akers served on the Ladies’ Committee for forty years, and her husband, sister, brother-in-law and son-in-law were also heavily committed to the Home.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> These personal connections have been observed in studies of other homes and similar organisations, Tennant found women in the Auckland Ladies’ Benevolent Society who were mother, sisters and daughters.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Both Ramey, and Howe and Swain found family connections on the committees of the Homes they studied.<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Personal connections, both social and familial, presumably played a role in why people became involved in the work of the All Saints’ Children’s Home.</p>
<p>The interconnectedness within, and between, the Trust Board and Ladies’ Committee was important as the members needed to work together in the complex business of running the Children’s Home. The role of the two groups is suggested by the names they were initially given. The Trust Board was also known as the Board of Control. The men were in charge of ensuring the financial security of the Home, dealing with insurance, mortgages and any maintenance, repairs or alterations that needed to be done. Calling the Ladies’ Committee the Board of Management indicated that they were responsible for the day-to-day business of the Home, like the purchases the Matron made and what material needs there were, such as clothing, furniture and appliances. The secretary of the Ladies’ Committee also assisted the Vicar with applications for admittance to the Home and dealt with employment issues. The existing minutes of the Ladies’ Committee meetings commence in 1938, and reveal they met monthly and had done for some time.<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Within the Committee, they had a sub-committee from which they appointed two members to visit the Home each month. From this it appears that the Ladies’ Committee were more frequent visitors to the Home, suggesting that they were more in touch with the day-to-day running and all the issues involved.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Board seems to have had a very hands-off approach, trusting the Ladies’ Committee to bring to their attention any matters with which they needed to deal. The Board minutes exist from 1906 to 1962 and show that the Trust Board often only met once or twice a year. In the very early years of the Home, they met much more frequently, sometimes every month, but on average every two months, from about 1910 until 1930. During the 1930s the minutes become very sparse, with none recorded between October 1938 and June 1944, after which the Board only seemed to meet to discuss specific issues that had arisen, and often in a combined meeting with the Ladies’ Committee. From 1944 until 1962 the minutes record that the Board met forty-one times, only six of those meetings being without the Ladies’ Committee present.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> From this it appears that the separate roles of the committees were becoming more blurred and the Ladies’ Committee was being consulted more.</p>
<p>One area that the Men controlled was grounds and maintenance, for which they had a separate committee. In 1956 the Ladies’ Committee asked that they take over responsibly for this area. They felt that it took too long to get problems with the building and grounds resolved, and wanted to be able to approve expenditure on these areas without having to go through the Trust Board. Instead they asked for a representative of the Board to attend their meetings when necessary.<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The matter was bought to the 1956 Annual General Meeting, at which point the Board became concerned about the financial implications of letting the Ladies’ Committee approve work. The matter was resolved by setting up a combined sub-committee.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> This is an example of the how the Ladies’ Committee was taking more control over running the Home. With the Trustees meeting infrequently and Ladies’ being much more in touch with the daily business of the Home, it appears that they were in control and the men acted on their recommendations. This shift of power could also be a reflection of changing role of women in the post-World War Two world. It seems that the Ladies’ Committee was given a much freer hand after 1945 than they had in the 1920s and 1930s. The roles of the two groups which ran the Home was defined but these seemed to have become less so, with the Ladies’ Committee taking a much larger role in the management of the Home.</p>
<p>The ways Board members and Ladies’ Committee members were appointed may have ensured that in general relationships within and between the groups were cordial. It can be assumed that those who served the Home were known to each other and as we have seen in some cases were married or related in other ways. There were, however, two people who were expected to serve on each group, but over whom other members had little control: the Vicar and his wife. Generally this relationship appears to have been excellent, but as Howe and Swain noted in their study of Melbourne Methodist children’s homes, these ex-officio members could cause issues, particularly if they became too ‘interested’.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> This problem arose within the Trust Board in the late 1920s. In 1927, Hugh Akers, a member of the Trust Board, gave one and half acres of land to the Trust for the purpose of building a new Home.<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> This began a disagreement between the Vicar at the time, Canon Fancourt, and other Board members as to what to build on the section. Fancourt wanted up to six cottage homes built; other members were in favour of erecting a building along the same lines as the one they already owned. This was put to the vote in June 1929 and the Board was evenly split.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The matter was only resolved when Fancourt left All Saints’ Parish at the end of 1929. By May 1930 plans for a single building had been drawn up<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> and the building was completed by March 1931.<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> As far as it is possible to conclude from the minutes of their meetings, the groups that managed the Homes had few other disagreements.</p>
<p>When the Home closed in 1964, the structure of the groups that managed the Home was also changed. The new constitution kept the same number of Board members, but now allowed for women as well as men members, and the requirement to be a member of the Church of England was removed.<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> All of the members on the new Board had previously served on either the Trust Board or the Ladies’ Committee. The profile of the Board remained as it had been in the first fifty-eight years, made up of middle-aged and middle-class people. This was the common experience of similar children’s homes and other welfare groups that were centred on children or families. We can not know the individual motivations of each of person who became involved in the All Saints’ Children’s Home, but their similarity in age and social status suggests that some common motivations may have been a belief that their position in society required them to give of their time and resources to those less fortunate. The fact that all members of the Trust Board and Ladies’ Committee were also members of the Church of England also suggests that nineteenth-century ideas of the Christian virtue of service may also have played a factor. This was particularly noticeable as both the Board and the Ladies’ Committee aged after the Second World War and had trouble attracting younger members. The people who served the Home also had family connections and this, combined with an homogeneity of age and social status, helped the Board and Ladies’ Committee to function smoothly, both within each group and between them. Each group within the structure had clearly defined roles, which fitted gender expectations of the time. These gradually changed, with the Board being much less involved and the Ladies’ Committee taking on more responsibility. It appears that there was a commonality of purpose when making decisions about the management of the Home. However, the balance was occasionally upset, with the Vicar not necessarily fitting in as easily as the volunteer members. This is illustrated by the dispute over what to build on the section donated for the new Home. There was a small group of committed people who gave a considerable amount of time and energy to the running of the All Saints’ Children’s Home. Without them it could not have functioned. They would probably have agreed with Canon Woodward when he wrote ‘It is indeed a privilege to be engaged in such a work as this’<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
