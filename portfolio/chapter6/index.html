         <h1>Chapter 6: Parental Agency</h1>
         <p><p><em>’It is appropriate for me to testify to the comfort such an<br />
institution can be to a distressed parent’<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p>
<p>The view of the relationship between parents and child welfare authorities has altered in the last forty years, as was discussed in the introduction. Once, children’s homes were thought to be a sign of a progressive, modernising society but this view shifted and they began to be seen as part of an attempt at social control. Since the late 1980s more recognition has been given to the role that families played in their interactions with child welfare organisations and it is now recognised that parents played an active role, often using child welfare groups for their own purposes. This can be seen in the interactions between parents and the All Saints’ Home. The last chapter showed that almost all the children that passed through the Home had at least one parent living and the ways parents used the Home are explored in this chapter. The process of placement is examined and the family circumstances behind the statistics are looked at, with a particular attention to how a lack of maternal presence in the family home was a factor. As most children had one or both parents living, the placing of children in the Home did not always mean the end of contact between children and their parents. How the parents and the Home authorities negotiated access is also explored in this chapter, with an emphasis on the efforts of parents. Children’s removal from the Home was nearly always at the request of parents, but was not always smooth, with the Board occasionally asking for removal. Another aspect of the relationship between parents and the Home covered here is the payment of parental contributions. This had a particularly gendered nature, with fathers most often asked to support their children. The relationship between the Home authorities and parents was complex and dynamic, with both parties taking an active role in the negotiations.</p>
<p>As a private home the Board could choose whom they admitted and during the life of the Home admissions were usually considered by the Vicar of All Saints’ and the Ladies’ Committee. Those charged with deciding on admissions took the Home’s role of providing for the most needy children in society very seriously and did not accept all the applications placed before them. In the 1907 Annual Report it was stated that the vast majority of applications were not accepted as they were ineligible.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It was not always parents who placed applications and it was not unusual for the Committee to deal with Vicars. This is probably because the local Vicar acted as a quasi social worker and became aware of problems or was asked to help families find solutions. The other place applications to the Home came from was Child Welfare Officers and this relationship will be explored in more depth in Chapter [RelationshipHomeGovernment].</p>
<p>It is easier to see how the admission process worked from 1938 as the Ladies’ Committee Minutes contain details. Applications that were turned down are sometimes noted in the minutes, but often no reason is given, although in 1941 the application of a mother in Waiouru was turned down because her children were neither orphan nor destitute.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> To ensure that the applicants were worthy, the Committee would sometimes ask the local Vicar to check the family circumstances. An example of this was a family from Taumarunui. Correspondence about the family between the Child Welfare Officer, Sister Spence, and the Home began in August 1945.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In March 1946 Sister Spence was told that the children could not be accepted as Taumarunui was in the Waikato Diocese and she should try Auckland Homes.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In the April 1946 minutes it was recorded that Sister Spence had sent three letters regarding the family and the Committee decided to ask for a letter from the local Vicar regarding the family’s circumstances.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> What was reported is unknown, but the children were not admitted.</p>
<p>Sometimes parents tried several times to get a place in the Home. In March 1948, Mrs Biggar applied for the admission of her two boys, but was refused on grounds of lack of staff.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> She approached the Home again in October and had one boy admitted,<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and the second was admitted in January 1949.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Sometimes the committee turned down one family while admitting another. In May 1948 a family from Hunterville was accepted but another family rejected because of lack of space.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Presumably the Committee had to decide which family had the greater need. As the Home aged there are fewer reports of admissions being turned down but it is difficult to know if this is due to lack of recording or lack of demand for places.</p>
<p>As Ramey points out, boards and parents viewed the role of children’s homes differently.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> As we have seen, the All Saints’ Board saw their home as a place for orphan and destitute children, but parents more often viewed the Home as place that cared for their children because they could not. When viewed through the lens of a father without a wife to care for the children, or a mother who had to take paid employment because she has no male support, the Home was a place that provided childcare. One family circumstance that occurs in many of the known reasons for admission to the Home is that there was either no mother present in the family home or the mother was ill, or divorced, and so had to find paid employment. This shows the importance that early and mid twentieth century society placed on fathers being the breadwinners for the family and mothers being the carers. When this pattern was disrupted, it became difficult for families to care for children. Either the father had to stop work to care for the children, therefore going without a wage, or the mother had to earn a wage, and could not provide care.</p>
<p>The death of a mother could lead to a child being placed in the Home very quickly. In 1938 Winifred Smith died, leaving seven children. The youngest three were admitted to the Home within months of her death.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Even in the late 1950s the death of a mother could lead to admittance to the Home. When the Lake family’s mother died in 1958, the father placed his five children in the Home after trying to manage for six months.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The desertion of a mother was another factor that could lead to admittance to the Home. In 1939 Mavis Walker came home from school to find her mother not at home and she and her four siblings were placed in All Saints’ by an aunt.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Graham Herdman’s mother left the family home in 1948 and he remembers that he and four of his five siblings were placed in the Home very quickly afterwards.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Sickness of the mother was also a factor. In 1916 two G girls entered the Home because their mother had been placed in a mental hospital and in the 1950s there were at least three families in the Home whose mothers were too ill to care for them.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>By contrast, in the case of death or desertion of a father it seemed to take longer for children to be placed. T was the first child to be admitted whose father had died. She was accepted in November 1906,<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> her father having died two years before.<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Charles Colson was placed in the Home in 1949, which was several years after his parents’ marriage failed, but it was his mother’s progressing multiple sclerosis that triggered her application, not her status as single parent.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Those who ran the Home may have seen their role as providing for children, but they were also providing a way for families to negotiate their way through difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>From when the Home opened, the Board understood that the children would be visited by family. In the first set of Home rules drawn up, visiting day was set as Wednesday afternoon, and there were to be no visits on Sunday.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> It is not possible to know how this was managed as no records exist of family visits. However, there is some evidence from oral histories and the Ladies’ Committee Minutes that some parents visited faithfully. Some children were allowed out to visit family and that this could cause tension. In June 1939 the Ladies’ Committee Minutes recorded that children were allowed one visit per month out of the Home and that visits to the Home were to made on Saturday between 2pm and 4pm.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> This once-a-month visiting rule was also in place in the Hawke’s Bay Children’s Home,<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and Musgrove, in her study of Melbourne homes, found a similar rule.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> This rule fits with memories of the Walker family, who went once a month to visit their grandmother and aunt. Mavis remembers this as being special as not all the children had family to take them out.<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In August 1949 it seems that children going out had become an issue between the Matron and the Committee.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Matron was reminded that she needed the Committee Secretary’s permission before allowing children to visit family and in November 1949 family visits both in and out of the Home were limited to one a month.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The Herdman family were in the Home during this period and both Shirley and Graham remember their mother and older brother as frequent visitors to the Home.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Mrs Herdman played the piano for the children, so it is possible that her visits were seen more as a service to the Home than a visit to her children and by offering this service she was able to see her children more often.</p>
<p>The matter of visits outside the Home came up again in March 1950,<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and it was reiterated that they were to be allowed only once a month. It seems likely that this was the result of some tension between the Committee and families who were taking their children more often, but it is not recorded if it was a specific family or generally families wanting to see their children that provoked reiteration of the rule. One of the ex-children from the Hawke’s Bay Children’s Home remembers that her mother was also a regular visitor and would turn up early in her desire to see her children, which annoyed the Matron.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Musgrove also found that many homes regarded the visiting by parents a burden and disruptive to its running.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> By the reminders occurring in the minutes, it appears that All Saints’ Ladies’ Committee may have felt the same.</p>
<p>As the 1950s progressed, it seems that the visiting day was changed to Sunday. Caroline Judkins remembers that her mother would visit her and her sisters for about an hour on Sunday and they would go for a walk, not stay at the Home. Occasionally, as a treat, they were allowed to visit their parents, who were living in a boarding house.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In February 1961 the Ladies’ Minutes state that visiting day was changing from Sunday to Saturday, 1.30pm until 5.30pm.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> When compared with the late 1940s, it seems that parents could now visit for a much longer time. Also, holidays were to be limited to a fortnight with family in January, not during term time. From the Matron’s Day Book, which has monthly entries from May 1960 until August 1964, it appears that this rule was not adhered to very strictly. The Book records children being allowed to go with family at Easter and other holidays.<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Christine Ramsey, who was in the Home from 1961 until its closure, remembers her father visiting every Saturday and taking her to visit her grandparents in Blenheim every May in the school holidays.<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> It is unclear whether the Home was being more lenient with parental visits or if parents were demanding more access, but it appears that the Matron and Ladies’ Committee became more relaxed about parental visiting towards the end of the Home’s life.</p>
<p>Visiting was not the only way the parents tried to maintain contact with their children. There are examples of parents writing letters, providing a service, or giving donations to the Home. As the Home took children from a large part of the lower North Island, it was not always possible for parents to visit their children. In the early records there is no evidence of letter-writing by parents, but this could be because these letters were recorded in the Ladies’ Minutes, which have survived only from 1938 onwards. There were two notable letter writers, Mrs A and Mrs M. It appears that Child Welfare was involved in both these cases so it is possible that their children had been forcibly placed in the Home.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Both these women were seeking reassurance that their children were being well cared for.</p>
<p>Another way that parents showed care for their children was by aiding the Home. Mr D, a firewood cutter, who had placed his children in the Home when his wife deserted the family, supplied the Home with firewood.<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Mrs Biggar offered to knit for her boys, if the Home supplied the wool.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Mrs C whose children were in the Home from 1939 until 1949, appears on the monthly list of donors.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> These examples show that parents actively sought to help the Home and their children, and were interested in supporting the children, even when the children could not live with them.</p>
<p>The fact that the children tended to stay in the Home for relatively short periods also shows that parents saw the Home as a place of temporary care, not a permanent solution. The rules of the Home stated that parents could remove their children with one week’s notice, as long as they were paying maintenance for them. Those that had free places, or were more than three months in arrears with maintenance payments, could only leave at the discretion of the Board.<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Most often it was parents who instigated the removal of their children from the Home.</p>
<p>Since putting their children in the Home was a strategy used by parents to survive difficult circumstances, it is not surprising that the most common reason for leaving the Home was a change in family circumstances, particularly re-marriage. In 1909 two boys were released to their mother, who had married the father of another child in the Home, his wife having died in childbirth.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Clive Shaw and his sisters left in 1943 when their mother remarried.<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Occasionally a marriage was reconciled; this was the reason for the Herdman’s discharge in 1953.<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Another factor that led to discharges in the 1950s was the availability of housing. There are two known cases where the children were discharged because their parents had moved into a state house.<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Sometimes older girls, who had finished their schooling, were discharged to family, particularly from the 1940s onwards. This is probably because they were now able to contribute to the family economy and did not need the day-to-day care that younger children did.</p>
<p>Even when parents instigated removal the Ladies’ Committee were not always happy to let the child go with the parent. In 1916 the Matron gave a report to the Board that convinced them to release two children to their mother, when previously they had been reluctant.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> There are several cases when the Ladies’ Committee sought reports from the Child Welfare Office before allowing children to be discharged to their family.<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Occasionally the Ladies’ Committee tried to get children discharged. In one case the Ladies felt that the family was not deserving enough.<a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> In another the child was a chronic bedwetter.<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In this latter instance it seems that the mother may have been able to convince the Committee to let her child stay as there is mention of him several years latter.<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Another area in which parents exerted their agency was in the removal of boys to Sedgely. In 1958 Mrs White was pressed to send her oldest son to Sedgley, but she resisted as she wanted her children to stay together, and close to her in Palmerston North.<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Towards the end of the 1950s the discharges to family began to drop off. Some children were returned to their families because they were causing issues in the Home,<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> but four of the five oral history participants from this period went on to other forms of care when they left All Saints’. This signals a change in the type of family that were using the Home, and the reason for this will be discussed in Chapter [TheClosureOfTheHome].</p>
<p>One of the areas in which the Board and parents experienced conflict was with the payment of maintenance. Within a few years of the Home opening, it was faced with the issue of parents who were in arrears with payment for their children. In October 1909 much of the Board meeting appears to have been taken up with discussing what do to with four fathers who were in arrears. Two had pleaded for concessions due to financial difficulties, another had disappeared, and one was to be threatened with legal proceedings.<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> One of these fathers was to continue to cause problems for the Board. His son had been placed on a farm, but under the constitution of the Home the Board retained control of the son’s earnings until he was sixteen. Just before his sixteenth birthday the Board sought legal advice as to whether they could continue to control the son’s earnings until the arrears were paid,<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> or if they could prevent the father from accessing the son’s money.<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The matter was finally resolved in court and the father was ordered to pay the Home £53.<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Not all parents were treated in the same way, and the Board seems to have been more lenient on mothers. Between 1906 and 1915 there are five recorded instances of fathers being taken to court,<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> but none of mothers. In July 1915 Mrs B wrote to say she was struggling with payments, and she had her payments reduced until she was in a better position.<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Another example occurred in 1916 when Mr O and Mrs Z both wrote to the Board about their debt. The Board replied to Mr O that they held him responsible for his debt but they decided to help Mrs Z.<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Ramey found in her study of two Pittsburgh Homes that their Boards were flexible about payments, particularly when approached with difficult parental circumstances,<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> as did Cmiel in the Chicago Orphanage he studied.<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Ramey saw this as an example of parental agency, that parents were prepared to negotiate with the Home authorities over the maintenance payments. It appears that this was also the case at All Saints’, but the Board was more likely to grant reduced payments to mothers. Musgrove found from her study of institutional care in Melbourne that fathers were expected to provide for their children, not mothers.<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>This pattern appears to continue at All Saints’ into the 1950s. When the Home had its most difficult financial years, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, one way the Board tried to improve finances was by increasing parental contributions.<a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> A committee was set up to look at parental payments and its report listed seven parents in arrears, two of whom were mothers. It recommended that action be taken against four fathers, but that one mother be written to and simply ‘reminded of her obligations.’<a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> In the case of the Herdman family, their father paid maintenance,<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> gave donations,<a href="#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> and was approached by the Ladies’ Committee to buy clothing for his children,<a href="#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> yet it appeared to be Mrs Herdman who was the active parent in the children’s lives.<a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> There are also two recorded cases where members of the Ladies’ Committee offered to assist mother’s efforts to get financial help from the Social Security Office.<a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The issue of parental payments ceased to be an issue in 1957 when the Board decided to accept the new capitation grant from the Government. One of the conditions of accepting this was not to refuse admission to any child because their parent or guardian could not pay.<a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>The quote at the beginning of this chapter comes from a letter written to the <em>Manawatu Evening Standard</em> by a grateful mother, who was encouraging people to donate to the Home. In the letter, she states that the Home ‘bridged a most difficult time in my life’.<a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The Home was set up to care for orphan and destitute children and the Board often saw the children in those terms. However, the sentiments expressed by this parent, that the Home was a way of overcoming a difficult period, was how most parents viewed it. Placement in the Home usually occurred because circumstances had led to the family being unable to follow the accepted pattern of father as bread winner and mother as carer. Once the children were admitted many parents maintained contact through visits, letter-writing and support for the Home. Discharge was usually instigated by the parents, but the Ladies’ Committee would sometimes attempt to block it or on the other hand try to force it. There are also examples of parents actively working against the attempts to discharge their children. The payment by parents of maintenance was an area that brought parents and the Board into conflict. However, the Board dealt with fathers more harshly than mothers, reflecting the prevailing view in society that fathers should provide for their children. Even though the authorities had more power than parents, parents were active in the relationship, negotiating outcomes that favoured them and their children.</p>
