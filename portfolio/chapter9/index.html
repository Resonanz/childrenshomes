<p><em>’Both in New Zealand and overseas there has been a trend away from large institutions’<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p>
<p>In August 1948 an article entitled ‘Orphanages Without Orphans’ appeared in the <em>New Zealand Listener</em> and it created such interest that the editor was still receiving letters six months later.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This article symbolised a change that was occurring around the way children’s homes were viewed in society. Both in New Zealand and overseas, institutions, like children’s homes, were coming under increasing criticism. This was because the focus of child welfare was shifting from the child and its environment to families, and particularly the importance of the child experiencing a ‘normal’ family life.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Society was also changing. Social security payments enabled more solo parents to care for their children without the need for full-time work and the development of day-care facilities provided more support for parents who had to work. If faced with sole parenthood, families now had many more options. Another change was the sharp rise in adoptions, which meant that children’s homes were no longer receiving as many illegitimate children and were experiencing more requests from people wanting to adopt children in homes. These trends caused a change in the type and numbers of children that All Saints’ cared for. Staffing also became an issue, not only in finding staff as explained in Chapter 3, but also meeting the pressure to employ staff who had trained in methods of child rearing and psychology. The difficult financial situation the Home experienced during the 1950s was discussed in Chapter 4 and the Board and Ladies’ Committee also had to deal with an ageing building which required a considerable amount of maintenance. All of these factors led to a general decline in children’s homes: when the All Saint’s home closed in 1964, it was part of a wider trend seen across all church homes.</p>
<p>In 1942 a small book was published by the New Zealand Council for Educational Research. It was entitled <em>The Institutional Care of Dependent Children in New Zealand</em> and was written by H.C.Matthew, a Presbyterian minister and a holder of a Diploma from the New York School of Social Work.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This book is notable in two ways: it claimed to be the first independent survey of children’s homes in New Zealand, and it was written by someone with social work qualifications, something very rare in New Zealand at the time.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The overall tone of Matthew’s work was that the quality of children’s homes varied greatly and that the care they offered was often inadequate and unaffected by new ideas.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In his conclusion he called for two changes. Firstly, there should be an increase in the use of social work principles which he believed would allow for more children to remain with their families. He pointed out that ‘today it has come to be almost universally recognised by social workers dealing with children that the family is the primary agency for the nurture and development of children.’<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> His second point was the need for homes to employ trained personnel, stating ‘Progress in every aspect of the work depends entirely upon the growth of fuller understanding of children and deeper insight of their needs’.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He was not just targeting staff, but believed that boards and management committees of Homes also needed training.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>These ideas were very much in keeping with international thoughts and trends. Developments in child psychology during the 1920s and early 1930s had begun to see family dynamics as the cause of problems in children, therefore families and family life became a focus of social work. In particular, work coming out of the Tavistock Clinic and the child guidance movement, both based in London, was expounding the importance of families.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> One of the psychiatrists that worked within these movements was John Bowlby, who subsequently studied children in institutional settings. His seminal work, <em>Maternal Care and Mental Health</em>, set forth his theory that deprivation of maternal care was the cause of mental health issues in children. These ideas became very influential in western culture,<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and had an effect on the way children’s homes were viewed, particularly leading to criticism that they did not provide a ‘normal family life’.</p>
<p>The [ch9:ChangingViews]ideas expressed by Matthew were making their way into the wider New Zealand culture. In 1948 an article appeared in the <em>New Zealand Listener,</em> entitled ‘Orphanages Without Orphans’, written by Doris Meares Mirams. The article was inspired by a British Committee of Inquiry into children deprived of a normal home life.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Its report was published in 1946, and became known as the Curtis Report, after the chair of the Committee, Myra Curtis.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The report had resulted in the British Government passing a new Children’s Act in 1948, which emphasised fostering children, rather than placing them in institutions, to provide them with a ‘normal home life’.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Many of Mirams’s criticisms of children’s homes echo Matthew’s: the need for training of staff and those running homes,<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and the need for children to stay with their families whereever possible.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, she was more harsh, focusing on the ‘unnatural’ ways that homes raised children, criticising the single-sex nature of many homes<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and highlighting the emotional problems that children’s homes supposedly caused.<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> She concluded with the statement that ‘large institutions no longer fit into our social pattern. More normal homes would produce more normal children.’<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The letters that responded to the article were varied, some supported Mirams; others, written by those who ran homes, defended them, saying that her attacks were unfounded. Mirams wrote a second article, the letters continued for six months, and the article, letters and a talk by Matthew entitled ‘The Home Deprived Child’ were eventually published as a book.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The fact that this article provoked an outpouring of opinions shows that New Zealanders were aware of some of the changes in philosophy that had been occurring around care for children, and illustrates that views of institutions were changing.</p>
<p>The increased emphasis on the family unit was being represented in other ways. The most fundamental change that affected children’s homes was the increase in social security provisions that occurred after the election of the first Labour Government in 1935. Deserted wives were able to claim a widows’ benefit from 1936, but only if they took proceedings against their husbands for maintenance. This measure was controversial<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and it seems that the Social Security department was not always sympathetic towards deserted wives.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In 1942 the Child Welfare Division began administering a ‘needy family’ fund which was designed to help the families that they came in to contact with.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The purpose of this was to help the family unit to remain intact by solving financial problems. The Social Security Department also had a special assistance fund which they could use to help those who were unable to make ends meet.<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The most important change, however, was the introduction of the Family Benefit in 1946. Unlike previous family payments it was universal, paid to the mother, and, at 10 shillings per week per child, very generous.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Although these benefits were designed to support the nuclear family, they also enabled sole parents to manage financially. Through a combination of benefits with perhaps only a little part-time work, it was becoming more possible for solo parents to keep their households intact. During the 1950s the discretionary benefits became a growing area of government activity, topping up existing provisions.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Labrum believes that this was accessed by women as a way of keeping their families together.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> There are examples in the Ladies’ Committee Minutes of members of the Committee helping families in the Home to access these provisions.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> As Dalley points out, the increasing number of benefits and a flexible attitude meant that many sole families were being supported by the state well before the introduction of the Domestic Purposes Benefit in 1973.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the availability of more financial support had an effect on the numbers of children being placed in homes, there was also a more general shift to providing more community support for sole parent families. An example of this was Birthright, an organisation founded in 1956 with the express purpose of helping mothers who were parenting alone. Initially, the idea was to help widows, but at the founding meeting this was widened to include mothers who were on their own due to separation, desertion or divorce.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The purpose of Birthright was to help the children of such families by providing support to enable the remaining parent to keep a stable household.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> A Birthright society was established in Palmerston North in 1959 and by the time of its first Annual General Meeting it was helping fifty-two families.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The president of Birthright Palmerston North was also on the Board of the All Saints’ Home,<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> suggesting that the interests of these two groups overlapped. The establishment of a group like this shows that society was become more accepting of sole parents and wanted children to stay with their parent. Since most of the children in children’s homes were from broken families, organisations like Birthright would have contributed to decreasing numbers of children coming into homes.</p>
<p>The growth of pre-school and day-care centres was another societal change that supported sole parents in the community. This was unintentional as, unlike Birthright, pre-school care was not specifically for solo parents, but its rising availability in the 1950s gave sole parents more options. The rise in pre-school care began during World War Two. Playcentres, which first opened in 1941, were designed to help mothers who were parenting alone due to war conditions.<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> They began opening in Palmerston North in 1943.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Post-war, the free kindergarten movement grew, with Palmerston North organising a Free Kindergarten Association in 1949.<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Kindergartens offered sessions, not all-day care, but they provided an affordable, and socially acceptable, form of child care for mothers who might need to work. All-day care also grew after World War Two. May points out that the expansion of day nurseries, or childcare, is difficult to trace due to the fact that all-day separation from the mother was believed to be harmful to the child, so such nurseries were often condemned. Despite this, it seems that childcare grew slowly but steadily during the 1950s,<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and as an indicator of this, in 1960 the government began to regulate centres.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In its first report to Government, the Child Welfare Branch listed forty day-nurseries.<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Because the history of day-care centres is difficult to follow, it was not possible to find out when the first day-centre opened in Palmerston North. However, like the availability of government benefits and the increase in community-based childcare, these centres helped sole parents to keep their children with them and survive financially.</p>
<p>The post-war rise in adoption of ex-nuptial babies is a well-recognised phenomenon.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The increase in the numbers of children being adopted was first noted in the Child Welfare Branch report to government in 1941. The Superintendent said that this was a pleasing trend and that 604 children had been adopted in 1940, the majority of those children being under five.<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The number of adoptions completed each year continued to increase, in 1944 the Child Welfare Office reported that 854 children were adopted, with applications generally coming from those couples without children.<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Adoptions peaked in 1971, with 3 976 orders, 6.17% of all live births,<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> but the culture of adoption of ex-nuptial babies was strongest in the 1950s.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> This rise has been linked to Bowlby’s work on maternal depravation<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and the idea that the best environment for the child was a permanent home, with a mother and father.<a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Adoption was seen as giving a child with ‘normal’ family which a single mother could not provide. The effect of this change in the way society viewed ex-nuptial children meant that they were no longer being placed in children’s homes. This had a direct impact on All Saints’, as shown in Chapter [TheChildrenAndFamiliesOfTheHome], and there seem to have been no illegitimate children in the Home from the mid 1940s. The demand for children to adopt was high in the 1950s and there are records of people writing to the Home asking if it had any children for adoption.<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> These were often answered with suggestions of children who were suitable, but none of the adoptions was finalised. Not only did the Home stop receiving ex-nuptial children, but children from broken homes were considered for adoption rather than remaining in the Home.</p>
<p>The changes outlined above all had another impact on All Saints’ Children’s Home. From the late 1950s onwards there was a noticeable trend for there to be more reports of behavioural issues among the children. It is difficult to tell if this is because the Ladies’ Committee and the Board were more sensitive to children’s behaviour or if the children were actually more difficult. In April 1961 there was trouble in the Home and some of the children were caught stealing, which required police involvement.<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> There was a fire set by some children in October 1962<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> and in May 1963 bars were fitted on the upstairs windows to prevent the children climbing out on to the roof.<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In September 1963 the Board was written to by a Department of Education psychologist who had examined four children in the Home. In the psychologist’s opinion the children displayed disturbed or difficult behaviour, which arose from them having been deprived of a normal family life.<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In November 1963 the Home admitted a family of five. This took the number of children to twenty-four and the Matron subsequently reported, ‘the behaviour of all the children has deteriorated to such an extent that from 3.30pm onwards every week day and all weekend this home becomes a mad house’. She was concerned that the new children were very unhappy and pointed out ‘They are all emotionally disturbed, as all the children here are, they all come from broken homes, where up until the time that one or the other parents walked out rows were the usual thing’.<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The 1964 Annual Report stated that 1963 had been a difficult year, because of ‘the number of young and emotionally disturbed children’.<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> With the growing support available to sole parents, it is possible that children were being admitted to the Home because there were multiple family problems. It is also possible that these were no worse than in the past, but the Board and Ladies Committee certainly perceived they were.<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The idea that the children were more troubled and more difficult to control was one of the factors that led to them considering closing the Home.</p>
<p>Although the numbers of children in All Saints’ did not decline markedly during the 1950s and early 1960s, there were changes in the type of children admitted and the length of their stay. It is difficult to measure the average length of stay over the early 1960s as the Board began trying to empty out the Home from mid 1963 onwards. However, it appears from the Matron’s daybook that many more children were staying in the Home for a short length of time. This can be seen in two ways, firstly in the number of temporary admissions of families and secondly in the fluctuating numbers of children in the Home. The temporary admission of families was not new to the Home: it had been used to house children on a short-term basis since it opened. However, it does seem that these placements were becoming more frequent in the late 1950s. In October 1958 the Ladies’ Committee minutes noted that three ‘temporary families’ had been removed.<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> In both August and September 1960 two girls were admitted on a temporary basis, on both occasions for three months.<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In May 1961 the Matron mentioned three boys who had gone home, but from her comment it is possible to tell that these boys had ‘gone home’ before, as she ends her entry on them with the comment ‘permanently - we hope.’<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> This trend was echoed in April 1962 when another family was ‘expected back for a short stay’<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> and in September 1962 a family that had been in temporarily between November and December 1961 was re-admitted.<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>These movements of children in and out of the Home led to fluctuating numbers. Figure ([ChildrenNumbersMarch1962July1964]) shows the numbers, month by month from March 1962 until July 1964 and 1963 appears to have been a particularly difficult year with numbers. It seems that the Home was becoming a place where parents were more likely to leave their children for a short time rather than in the past when the Home was used as a more long-term solution. As was noted in Chapter [ParentalAgency], the most common trigger for the removal of a child from the Home was a change in family circumstance, particularly surrounding the financial situation of the parent. With increased access to State help, it is possible that children were staying in the Home for shorter periods because it was much easier for a solo parent to achieve financial security.</p>
<p>[htbp]<embed src="Figures/ChildrenNumbersMarch1962July1964.pdf" width="793" /></p>
<p>Obtaining staff had been an issue for the Home since the Second World War. From the late 1950s the Board and Ladies’ Committee were also under pressure to employ a certain kind of staff, with some kind of training in childcare. The first indication that the Ladies’ Committee were realising that a change in staffing was needed came in early 1958. After the resignation of Lucy Elliot, the Committee decided to look for a married couple to run the Home rather than a Matron.<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> This shows the idea of of children experiencing a ‘normal family environment’ was influencing the decisions of the Ladies’ Committee. Although the Ladies’ Committee may have had an ideal of a married couple, they were unable to find one willing to work in the Home and they appointed another Matron in March 1958.<a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>The Child Welfare Office also recognised that children’s home staff should be trained and began offering courses during the school holidays. Miss Robinson, the Matron, attended a refresher course in August 1959<a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and in August 1960 the sub-matron attended a similar course.<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The Education Department psychologist who wrote to the Board in 1963 stated that the the children’s difficulties were ‘best tackled by staff with training and experience in dealing with emotionally disturbed children.’<a href="#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>However, the problem of staff turnover recurred, with assistants coming and going rapidly.<a href="#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Christine Ramsey, who was in the Home from 1961 until its closure, remembers that the young assistants were nice but never stayed very long.<a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The turnover in Matrons was also high: there were four Matrons between May 1961 and the closure of the Home in July 1964. Larger institutions, like All Saints’, were becoming harder to staff and these problems would have led to the Board considering a different way of caring for children.</p>
<p>We have already seen in Chapter [EmploymentOfStaffForTheHome] and Chapter [HowTheHomeWasSupported] that as the Home aged the Board had to deal with the practical problems of finding employees and decreasing donations coupled with rising costs. Another practical issue they had was the large and ageing building. The Pascal Street Home, built in 1931, was becoming more costly to maintain and was not easily adaptable to modern theories of childcare. In August 1961 a sub-committee, consisting of three members of the Trust Board, made a thorough inspection of the building during the school holidays when the children were staying at Brown House.<a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> At a Board meeting in September 1961, the initial reports were discussed. The sub-committee believed it would cost a considerable amount to bring the Home up to modern standards and that, considering that demand for places was decreasing, it might be better to sell the building and construct a new one.<a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Mrs Langley, the secretary of the Ladies’ Committee agreed with this, saying that it was not worth continually patching up the Home.<a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The report was considered again in December 1961 and it was decided not to take any action in regards to a new Home.<a href="#fn70" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The Annual report for 1962 states that a considerable amount of money had been spent, which brought the Home into an up-to-date condition.<a href="#fn71" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> What the Board could not fix was the fact that the building had been built for around forty children and they did not have the demand to fill these spaces any more. Not only was the building ageing, but it was now too large and could not be altered to make it more suitable for the family-type care that now thought best for children.</p>
<p>In mid 1963 the Board decided to close the Pascal Street home. There is no official document to support this, but there are two pieces of evidence to suggest that the announcement of closure in July 1964 had been planned for some time. In early 1963, D.C Pryor, a member of the Board, wrote to the Director of Social Services of the Diocese of Christchurch. Although a copy of Pryor’s letter has not survived, the reply has. It is possible to ascertain that Pryor was seeking advice about how the Christchurch Diocese had moved from children’s homes to a combination of foster and family homes. J Morrison, a social worker, replied that the problems All Saints’ faced were similar to those in Christchurch ten years before. The solution had been to focus attention on providing ‘natural family or family substitutes’<a href="#fn72" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> through foster or family homes with a married couple in charge and seven to eight children. Morrison also stated the the key staff member was a caseworker, who could work with the child, parent and foster family.<a href="#fn73" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> At the beginning of 1964 the Board appointed a social worker, Hughla Scott. It is unclear when Mrs Scott started work, but in the 1964 Annual Report her appointment is described as a ‘wise move’ and that she ‘has been able to give much needed relief the the Secretary of the Ladies’ Committee’. The report also states that she had been able to find foster homes for some children, before they were committed to the Home.<a href="#fn74" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Another indication that the Home was going to close was that it began emptying out from late 1963. The decrease in numbers can be seen in figure ([ChildrenNumbersMarch1962July1964]). The principal of the school the children went to remembered a sharp decline in the numbers of children in the Home from mid-1963.<a href="#fn75" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The Matron’s Daybook documents the leaving of children for foster homes from April 1964.<a href="#fn76" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> By July 1964 only nine children remained, most of whom were transferred to a family-style home which the Trust bought in July 1964.<a href="#fn77" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>When All Saints’ Children’s Home closed it doors in August 1964, it was part of a much wider trend. Within the network of homes under the Wellington Diocese, St Mary’s Homes in Karori had progressively closed their facilities from 1952 onwards,<a href="#fn78" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> with the last, Duncan Cottage, closing in 1962.<a href="#fn79" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The St Barnabas’ Babies’ Home changed its focus to work with unmarried mothers.<a href="#fn80" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The Lower Hutt Boys’ Home had closed in 1958<a href="#fn81" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> and after All Saints’ closed only Sedgley remained open. The Auckland Diocese began closing its homes in 1958.<a href="#fn82" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The Presbyterian Social Service Association Otago also closed its remaining homes at Anderson’s Bay, near Dunedin, in 1964, and like All Saints’ used a mixture of foster and family homes.<a href="#fn83" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> The trend for children’s homes to close in favour of foster care and family homes was also noted by the Child Welfare Division. In its 1965 report to Government on registered children’s homes, the superintendent noted that eleven family homes had been established and several more were planned. He also stated that the number of children under the control of home authorities, but in foster care, had risen 40% since 1962.<a href="#fn84" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The decision the All Saints’ board made to close the Home was very much in keeping with trends within other New Zealand Homes.</p>
<p>When ‘Orphanages without Orphans’ appeared in 1948, the opinions Mirams expressed may have been limited to those in society with a special knowledge and interest in child welfare. But by 1964 the whole focus of social work with children had moved firmly towards the importance of a child experiencing a ‘normal’ family life, and society supported the family model. This shift is illustrated by the availability of benefits for sole parents, the existence of specific organisations to support them, and the availability of childcare. All of these made it much easier for children to remain with their parents when families experienced some form of breakdown. This led to children’s homes being used in a different way than in the past. They became places of temporary care, or for children of families with multiple problems. The more transient and difficult nature of the children All Saints’ was receiving was one of the reasons the management began to look for other ways of carrying out work with children. The Home also had problems finding staff and had pressure on it to employ trained staff. The age of the building was also an issue and the Board were forced to make decisions about whether to upgrade the building or move on from the large, ageing, institutional setting. Sometime in 1963 the Board decided to close the Home, they began reducing numbers and, in 1964 employed a social worker to help find foster homes. When it closed its doors in August 1964, the All Saints’ Children’s Home was following a fundamental shift to foster care and family homes.</p>
