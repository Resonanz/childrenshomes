<p><em>’The Church is caring for children who have lost one or both parents and are thrown on the world’</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>According to the original constitution of the All Saints’ Home it was intended for orphan and destitute children.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In reality the Home cared for very few orphans: most of the children who lived in the Home were there as a result of some kind of family breakdown, and had a least one parent living. Initially this chapter will look at the numbers of children that were in the Home and analyse the fluctuations over the period it was open. Statistics on the Home were collected by the Government from 1912 to 1947 and these are used to track admissions, discharges and the gender balance. The Child Welfare Reports from the 1950s also contain information about numbers and the gender split within the Home. No record of the ethnicity of the children was kept by the Home authorities, but anecdotal and photographic evidence suggests that from the 1930s until its closing the Home had a number of Māori children in its care. The admission records from 1906 to 1919 have survived, although in some cases they are not complete. These records provide information on the age and circumstances of the children, particularly who placed them in the Home and why. An effort has been made to reconstruct later admissions and to track the family circumstances of the children. This was most successful for the 1940s and 1950s, partly because oral histories were conducted with some ex-children from this period. These two time periods are contrasted to show how the role of the Home shifted. As it aged, the Home was much more likely to receive children from separated and divorced parents, rather than from parents whose spouses had died. It was also possible to gain some understanding of the average age at entry and average length of stay, which also altered as the Home aged. Although those that ran children’s homes liked to portray them as places for children without families, in the vast majority of cases children had at least one parent still living.</p>
<p>The rapid growth in the numbers within the All Saints’ Children’s Home was touched on in Chapter [TheOpeningOfTheHome]. In the first two years, the numbers presented at the Annual General Meeting more than doubled: there were nine children in 1907<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and twenty-one in 1909.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Figure ([NumbersOfChildren]) shows the trends in the total number of children cared for the by Home between 1907 and 1964. Once the initial period of growth and expansion ended in 1909, the numbers of children remained at around the mid-twenties until 1920, when they climbed to thirty-two. In 1923 an alteration was completed which allowed for twelve more children.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The numbers did not increase dramatically thereafter, suggesting that the Home had been overcrowded.</p>
<p><embed src="Figures/NumbersOfChildren.pdf" width="755xxy" /></p>
<p>The numbers in the Palmerston North Home dropped slightly in 1925, when the Foxton Home was opened, but began to climb again, peaking in 1929, with sixty-six children across the two homes. This was the high point and the numbers fell slowly during the 1930s. The Foxton Home was closed in 1933 and its children transferred to Palmerston North. Admissions were restricted, with only twenty-eight children admitted between 1932 and 1937, and no new children were accepted in 1934.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This was a response to the Depression and the need to cut costs.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The numbers began climbing again in the late 1930s, but did not reach those of the late 1920s. Controlling costs by restricting the number of children was used again in the early 1950s when there were large financial deficits.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>From about 1956 onwards the numbers in the Home began to decline, reaching a low point in 1959 of eleven children. The numbers rose again in the early 1960s, possibly because the closure of other children’s homes meant that All Saints’ was taking children from those homes.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> However, a detailed record of the number of children by month, which exists from August 1961 until July 1964, shows that the numbers fluctuated. For example in November 1963 there were fifteen children and in December 1963, twenty-four.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Even though the numbers of children did rise in the early 1960s, this needs to be placed against the general rise in the number of children in the population due to the baby boom. Compared to the population as a whole, the percentage of children in homes was much less than it had been in the pre-World War Two era.</p>
<p>The 1920s was the decade when the number of children in homes peaked in New Zealand.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In the mid-1920s there were eighty-five private children’s homes, in 1929 they housed over 4 000 children. This was also the period when the numbers in the All Saints’ Home peaked. By the mid 1940s the numbers of children in homes in New Zealand had decreased to less than 3 000, and there were about eighty homes, suggesting that each home was caring for fewer children.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> This was true of All Saints’. Its new building, opened in 1931, was designed for thirty-six children, but the Home rarely had that many children in residence. It is worth noting that when the Trust Board and Ladies’ Committee began discussing plans for the new building, they were thinking about a home to accommodate up to sixty children.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> It was cost that caused them to settle on a smaller plan, but in the early 1930s the Board believed that it would need to extend the building when more funds became available.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The only change made to the second building was in 1937 when a room, which slept four, was added for the older girls.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1955 there were seventy homes in New Zealand and about 1 800 children being cared for.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> This was a significant drop over ten years, probably caused by a combination of the introduction of social security and the problems children’s homes had obtaining staff during and immediately after World War Two.<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Interestingly, All Saints’ Home did not experience a significant drop in numbers between the mid-1940s and mid-1950s. This is possibly because they had a stable staff situation between 1950 and 1957 and with other Homes within the Wellington Anglican Diocese closing they became the only option for girls within the network.<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The year the All Saints’ Children’s Home closed, 1964, there were sixty-eight registered homes caring for about 1 500 children.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Again this suggests that fewer children were being cared for in each Home and this was certainly the case at All Saints’, with sometimes only eleven children in a building designed for around forty. Although the closure of the Home will be dealt with in more detail in Chapter [TheClosureOfTheHome], the drop in the number of children needing care in homes was partly behind the Boards’ decision to close the Home in 1964.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that boys were more likely to be admitted to children’s homes than girls and government statistics show that the number of boys in homes was consistently higher than girls.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Data on the balance between boys and girls within the All Saints’ Home are available for between 1912 and 1958 and boys dominated the Home until 1936, as shown in figure ([GenderBreakdown]). In the first building the Trust owned there were more beds for boys than girls. It is difficult to know whether this was a conscious decision or one driven by demand. The addition completed in 1923 appears to have been a boys’ dormitory,<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> suggesting that there was more demand for places for boys. Records for the gender split of the children in the Foxton Home exist for 1929 to 1932.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> These show that the number of girls was higher than boys in that Home, so there could also have been a policy of placing girls in Foxton and boys in Palmerston North where possible.</p>
<p>From[Sedgley] 1931 the number of boys in the Home started to decrease. There was a drop in the early 1930s, twenty-six boys being discharged in 1931. This was probably because the new building, which was occupied in March 1931, had an equal number of beds for boys and girls. Unfortunately it is not known where these boys were discharged to, but another factor influencing the number of boys in All Saints’ was the opening within the Wellington Anglican Diocese of a second home for boys in 1926. This home, based in Masterton and called Sedgley, was for older boys and All Saints’ began a relationship with it sometime in the late 1920s through which older boys from All Saints’ were sent to Sedgley. In 1928 a policy was put in place that no boys over the age of twelve were to remain in the Home,<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and government statistics show that boys over the age of ten were declining in the Home from 1931. By 1938 there were only two.<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This affected the balance of genders, with girls dominating from 1936 and there were only two years in which boys outnumbered girls after this.</p>
<p>During the early 1940s the Home admitted a larger than usual number of younger boys which led to a slightly higher number during the mid to late forties. This probably contributed to a change in policy in 1949, when boys were to be sent to Sedgley at age ten,<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> although the official statistics suggest that this policy may have been operating before late 1949 as there were no boys aged over ten present in the Home after 1948.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>There were two other factors leading to girls becoming dominant in the Home. In the early 1950s St Mary’s Homes in Karori, which had acted as sister homes to Sedgley and the Lower Hutt Boys’ Home, closed.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Added to this was the rise in the school leaving age and the trend for girls to go on to high school which emerged in the the late 1940s. Girls stayed in the Home longer, which is reflected in a rise the proportion of girls over the age of ten in the Home during the 1950s. In 1939 about one quarter of the girls were aged over ten,<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> by 1956 almost half were.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p><embed src="Figures/GenderBreakdown.pdf" width="755" /></p>
<p>It is difficult to know whether the changes experienced in the gender balance within All Saints’ were typical of other homes in New Zealand. This is partly because there has not been any other detailed examination of gender within New Zealand homes. Another issue is that All Saints’ mix of genders was atypical of children’s homes. Although some homes may have begun with mixed genders, during the 1920s there was a tendency for homes to become for either boys or girls.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Within Palmerston North there was another mixed gender home, the Willard Home, run by the Women’s Christian Temperance Union. Records of the gender split for this home exist from 1923 until 1947. Like All Saints’ there was a domination of boys during the 1920s, but during the 1930s and 1940s there was a slight domination by girls, with 1932 being the first year that there were more girls than boys.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> As Willard was not part of a network of homes there is no immediately obvious explanation for this trend. It appears that the gender balance of children’s homes is not clear cut and there is room for more research on this issue.</p>
<p>There were no records kept of the ethnicity of children within homes in New Zealand and there seems to be mixed opinions as to whether Māori children were placed in Homes. Dalley notes that between 1925 and 1948 Child Welfare would sometimes send Māori children to private institutions rather than to state-run facilities.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Tennant found that the Auckland Methodist Orphanages had a policy to accept Māori children only in ‘special and unusual circumstances.’<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The general belief is that traditional Māori kin networks meant that Māori children whose parents could not care for them were likely to be looked after by extended family rather than placed in a children’s home.<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The persistence of this belief is illustrated when in 1961 the Child Welfare Office surveyed children’s homes about ethnicity for the first time. Surprise was expressed at the number of Māori children in private institutions, 173, which was described as being ‘more than might be expected.’<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>No official figures were kept of the ethnicity of children in the All Saints’ Home, but evidence that Māori children were in the Home exists. A photograph of the children in the Home that appeared in <em>Manawatu Evening Standard</em> in 1933 clearly shows three Māori boys.<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> This is corroborated by the memories of someone who was at school with children from the Home in the late 1930s. He distinctly remembers two Māori families from the Home.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> There is a reasonable amount of photographic evidence from the 1950s which shows that the Home had three or four Māori children at any one time. Based on the photographs it is estimated that there were about six Māori families over the decade. The two families admitted in January 1962 were Māori, and one had already been in a children’s home in Gisborne.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Dalley notes there was no wholesale removal of Māori children from their communities into institutions,<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> as occurred among indigenous populations in other countries. However, Māori families were present in the All Saints’ Home and this could be indicative of a more widespread use of children’s homes by Māori families than is sometimes assumed.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>As Morris Matthews points out in her examination of Hawke’s Bay children’s homes, there is a common belief that the children who were cared for in homes were mostly illegitimate.<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> This belief is contradicted by another, that private children’s homes did not ‘touch’ illegitimate children.<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The fact that homes are sometimes referred to as orphanages also led to the belief that the children in them had no living parents. None of these ideas matches the origins of the children cared for by the All Saints’ Home. The reason for the placement of fifty-seven children between 1906 and 1919 can be ascertained because the admission records from this period are available. Using oral histories, Ladies’ Committee Minutes and newspapers, it was possible to gain some understanding of the family circumstance surrounding the placement of fifty-nine children in the Home from the late 1930s onward. The Government also collected information about the family circumstances of children’s homes ‘inmates’ from 1925 to 1947. These can be used to ascertain whether the patterns of family circumstances shown at All Saints’ were in line with general trends in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Figure [ChildrenCircumstances] [Ch5:TwoParentsLiving]shows the contrast between reasons children were admitted over the two periods, one between 1906 and 1919 and the other 1938 to 1963. In both periods most children within the Home had both parents living. The first year national figures on children’s family circumstances are available is 1925, and these show that 25% of children in Homes had both parents living.<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> This is much lower than All Saints’ which was 53%. Having two parents living does not necessarily mean that those children were from families where the parents had separated or divorced. In at least five known cases the children were admitted due to their mother being ill. Although it is difficult to know why All Saints’ had a larger number of children with two parents living, it is possible that the admission criteria for the Home were less strict than others, meaning they were more likely to receive applications from separated parents. For example the Auckland Methodist Orphanage had a criterion that stated absolute orphans first, then those who had lost one parent through death, then those that had divorced parents and only non-Methodists in exceptional circumstances.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a>All Saints’ had a much more open admission policy, and mentioned that there would be no discrimination on the basis of denomination and that the needs of the family were most paramount.<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>The second most common reason for children to be admitted between 1906-1919 was the death of their mother. The All Saints’ figure was 14%, much less than than the 1925 national average which was 33% of those being cared for. The percentages of those children in All Saints’ whose father had died, who were illegitimate or orphans were similar to the national average, with the New Zealand-wide figure for death of a father being 12.5% and All Saints’ 11%; the illegitimate percentage being 16.3% nationally and 12% in All Saints’, For orphans, the national figure was 9%, and for All Saints’ 11%.<a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The illegitimate figure shows that private homes did take illegitimate children and it is worth noting that the second child admitted to All Saints’ Home was illegitimate, so there was no policy to exclude ex-nuptial children.<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>In a study of the St. Vincent de Paul Orphanage for girls, McLeod analysed 135 surviving admission records, which were dated between 1898 and 1924.<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> She found that most of the girls were illegitimate, possibly up to 64%, 13% were in the orphanage because their mother had died, 17% because their father had died and 3% were actual orphans.<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> This is quite a different pattern to both the national figures and those displayed within the All Saints’ Home. It is possible that different homes had reputations for taking certain types of children, but until a large-scale study of home admissions is conducted it is difficult to know why there are such differences.</p>
<p><embed src="Figures/ChildrenCircumstances.pdf" width="793" /></p>
<p>The pattern displayed in the reasons for admission between 1906 and 1919 continued from 1930s onwards. The vast majority of children in the Home, 71%, had two parents living. This figure is similar to the national figure for 1945, which was 73%.<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The dominance of this category was increased by the sharp reduction, shown in the 1939 national figures, for those children with one parent alive, and particularly in the number of children whose father had died. This was due to the introduction of social security, which raised the existing widows’ benefit.<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Within the All Saints’ Home neither of these categories changed significantly but it is possible that those children who entered the Home with one parent living did so because the surviving parent was ill, as this was a factor in two known cases.</p>
<p>One more area where the Home differed from national statistics was that it still admitted more orphans. The national figure in 1945 was less than 0.1% yet that for All Saints’ was 5%. This figure represents one family of three, which were placed in the Home by Child Welfare, so it is somewhat distorted. The national figure for illegitimate children in homes in 1945 was 9.1%, yet, as far as can be ascertained, there was none in the All Saints’ Home. This is probably a reflection of a change in societal attitudes towards solo families and the increasing adoption culture meaning more babies were being adopted at birth.<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Another difference between the early period of the Home and the later years was the age at which children were admitted to the Home. Using the admission records, it was possible to calculate the average at admission between 1906-1919, which was four-and-a-half years. For the period from 1938 onwards it was possible to find the age at admission of fifty-four children and the average age was seven-and-three-quarter years. In the early years the Home was more likely to receive children at a younger age. This is also noticeable from the government records of age breakdown,<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> which show a higher proportion of children aged under five from the 1910s to the early 1920s. This is best explained by a change in admission policy which restricted entry to children over three.<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> It is not clear when this was implemented, but the opening of St Barnabas Home for Babies in 1922<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> would have provided an alternative for the placement of younger children within the Anglican network of homes.</p>
<p>The average length of stay was also shorter in the 1940s and 1950s than between 1906 and 1919. In the earlier years the average length of stay was five-and-a-quarter years whereas in the 1940s and 1950s it was around three-and-one-quarter years. The longest period any children spent in the Home was fourteen years spent by two girls between 1906 and 1920.<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The shortest stays were probably not recorded as the Home was occasionally used for temporary accommodation. The average length of stay was also broken down by gender. For the period 1906-1919 there was very little difference, with girls staying marginally longer than boys, but for the period 1940-1955 girls stayed almost twice as long as boys, with their average stay being four years, and boys two-and-a-half years. This can be explained by the removal of boys between the ages of ten and twelve to Sedgley as discussed in this chapter.</p>
<p>By combining the average admission age with average stay, the average age each child left the Home was calculated and it was similar for both periods. Between 1906 and 1919 the average age of a child leaving the Home was nine-and-three-quarter years and for 1938 to 1961 it was eleven years. This was possibly a reflection that Homes were being used by parents to care for their children during the ages they needed more intensive care and when they were not able to contribute to the family. Once the child was in the late primary years, the care the parent had to provide was less demanding and the child was able to help at home.</p>
<p>There appears to have been no other studies of average ages and length of stays in children’s homes in New Zealand. Penglase interviewed ninety children who had been in children’s homes in New South Wales and she used their information to calculate their average age on admission and average stay. The ex-children she studied were in homes at a younger age and for longer periods than those in All Saints’. Most of her participants were under seven when they entered a home and they stayed for seven years.<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> This suggests that homes in New South Wales had a different pattern and possibly a different role from those in New Zealand. However, there is not enough information on New Zealand homes to be sure if the pattern shown by All Saints’ is typical.</p>
<p>The idea that All Saints’ Children’s Home only cared for children who had lost one or both parents is misleading: most children who passed through the Home had two parents living. The numbers of children in the Home increased rapidly in the first two years and again in the early 1920s. When the Foxton Home was opened in 1925, the Trust Board had a maximum of sixty-eight children under its care. This would prove to be the peak of numbers, with a decline in the number of children in the care of the Home from the 1930s onwards and this pattern matched national trends. All Saints’ cared for more boys than girls until 1936, when the balance was reversed. Although boys were dominant in national figures through to when records cease in 1947, All Saints’ cared mainly for girls from 1937 onwards. This is partly due to its place within the Wellington Anglican Diocese network of homes. It is difficult to know if the gender balance was typical of other New Zealand children’s homes and there is room for more investigation of this subject. Another under-researched area is the placement of Māori children in homes. Photographic and anecdotal evidence suggests that All Saints’ cared for a number of Māori families yet again it is difficult to know how usual this was. The reasons for admission to All Saints’ between 1906 and 1919 follow national trends, but it did contain more children with two parents living than the national averages. By the 1940s and 1950s a large majority of children in the Home had two parents living, matching national trends. This was partly due to the increased widows’ benefit meaning that it was easier for widows to keep their children with them. The average age that children were placed in the Home increased over time and the average length of stay shortened. There appears to be no New Zealand figures to compare this trend to, but the pattern displayed by the All Saints’ Home is different to that observed in New South Wales. Some of the individual circumstances of families will be explored in the next chapter, but the typical child in the All Saints’ Children’s Home had two parents living and spent his or her primary school years in the Home.</p>
