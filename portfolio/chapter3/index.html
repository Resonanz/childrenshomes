         <h1>Chapter 3: Employment of Staff for the Home</h1>
         <p><p><img src="Pictures/NZHAdvert.png" alt="image" width="377" /></p>
<p>Over the fifty-eight years the Home was open, the staffing demands, and types of people who were employed as staff varied and altered. It is difficult to gauge accurately how many staff were employed at any one time due to a lack of definitive records. However, by using the Trust Board and Ladies’ Committee Minutes as well as Annual Reports, Child Welfare Reports and newspapers, it was possible to gain some understanding of the issues around the employment of staff. One of the features that changed was the number of workers employed, which varied from two or three in the earlier years, to seven towards the end of the Home’s life. Another aspect that altered was the number of staff who lived in the Home as it became increasingly harder to find residential staff from the 1950s. The Home was almost exclusively staffed by women, although men were sporadically employed as gardeners. There was no typical type of woman employed. There was, however, one aspect that many of the residential female staff had in common: they were without male support. Another trait that some employees shared was that they were recent immigrants to New Zealand. Although the staff the Home employed could be considered vulnerable, they were not without agency, using the threat of resignation to protect their interests. Having quality staff was vital to the smooth running of the Home and finding employees was not always easy. As the labour market tightened and opportunities opened up for women, during and after the Second World War, it became more difficult to find and keep staff.</p>
<p>There were three types of staff employed at the Home. Residential staff, house-girls, who were children too old for school, but too young for domestic service, and workers employed to come in during the day. The house-girls’ role within the Home is examined in Chapter [LifeInTheHome] as they were technically still under the control of the Home.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In general, those staff that came in during the day did domestic tasks, like the laundry and the cleaning or helped with meal preparation. This also included the periodic employment of a male gardener. Although the daily staff were important because they helped the residential employees, they usually did not have any contact with the children. Therefore, when discussing how many employees looked after the children, the house-girls and daily staff have not been included.</p>
<p>The Home appears to have opened with one staff member, the Matron.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> By the time of the first Annual General Meeting, the staff consisted of the Matron and one assistant and there was discussion about employing another assistant.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> At the time the Home had nine children, there was one staff member for every four and half children. The All Saints’ Parish Magazine reported on the Home’s first inspection by a Child Welfare Officer in 1908, noting that the Officer had praised the high ratio of staff to children. The Home had nineteen children with three residential staff and one daily assistant.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Thus the ratio of children to live-in staff had already increased, becoming one staff member for just over six children. As the number of children in the Home grew, reaching its peak in 1923,<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> the number of residential staff did not. The original Home in Ferguson Street had only enough room for three residential staff and there were extra spaces added for children, but not for staff. This reached crisis point in 1924 when the Child Welfare Officer reported that the Home was understaffed, with thirty-six children and three staff.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This may have resulted in the next Matron being a married woman. With her husband also living at the Home, there was an extra residential adult.</p>
<p>When the new building was opened in 1931, it had enough rooms to allow up to four residential staff.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Although it was difficult at times to maintain this level, the number of children remained fairly consistent at around thirty-five. This meant that if the Home was fully staffed, the ratio of employees to children was around one to nine. This seems to have been a reasonably common staffing level. A publicity booklet for the South Island Methodist Orphanage and Children’s Home states that they appointed staff on a one to ten ratio.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Ramey found in her study of two children’s homes in Pittsburgh that they had a ratio of one to six or seven, which was lower than the United States average of one to ten.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Towards the end of the 1950s pressure was placed on the Home by Child Welfare to increase the number of staff they employed.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> [NewBuilding]By 1961 the Home had four live-in staff and three daily staff, one of whom came in the evenings.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The number of children in the Home was seventeen, so there was almost one staff member for every four children, a similar ratio to when the Home opened.</p>
<p>During various periods in the life of the Home it proved difficult to employ and retain staff, meaning the ideal ratio of staff to children was not always maintained. The first mention of a staff shortage was in 1921.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> At this time the number of children in the Home was growing, and the Matron, Mrs Spensley, had been ill.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> It is difficult to gauge whether there were difficulties with finding staff before 1938, as this is when the existing Ladies’ Committee minutes start. It is noticeable that from 1942 it became harder to find and keep staff. Initially the issues were with the younger staff being called up for essential war work. In 1942 the Home had two staff ‘manpowered’, one in June<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and her replacement in November.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> By early 1945 the staff shortage was described as serious. Advertisements were placed and the Ladies’ Committee discussed the need to find a woman to help with the washing and ironing.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> It was noted in March<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and April<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> that there had been no replies to the advertisements. In June one appointment had been made<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> but by November 1945 the Home was short staffed again.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> This theme continued, with the staff situation being ‘acute’ in April 1946<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and in 1948 none of the women offered the vacant positions took them up when the Sub-Matron and Matron left.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The turnover in staff continued and when the cook left in July 1949 an application was made for a displaced person.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The entire staff resigned in August 1949<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and in November 1949 the Home was reported to be in disarray due to lack of staff and the changes in staff.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The arrival of Lucy Elliot as Matron in April 1950 settled the situation and despite the fact that it was difficult to find four residential staff the decision was made to stick with this model.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> By 1952 the Home was able to maintain staffing levels.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> However, a new trend had emerged as the temporary outside help that the Home had used while unable to get residential staff were retained.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> During the mid-1950s the staff remained reasonably stable but by 1956 problems were again emerging.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In 1957 a Child Welfare Officer addressed a combined meeting of the Trust Board and Ladies’ Committee on the issue of staff numbers.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The matter had already been raised by the Matron. Rather than increase the number of staff, those at the meeting decided to limit the number of children to twenty-five.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> This reflects the realisation that the only way to sustain the required level of staff to children was to reduce the numbers of the latter. For the remainder of the time the Home was open, the number of outside staff increased so that by 1961 there were almost as many outside staff as residential.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>These issues were not unique to All Saints’ Children’s Home. St Mary’s Homes in Wellington were in danger of closing due to lack of staff during the Second World War, only the availability of Church Army workers enabling them to keep functioning.<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Morris Mathews’s study of Abbotsford, an Anglican Home near Waipawa, found that by 1957 it was relying more on the labour of older girls as there were few staff remaining.<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Howe and Swain noted that the Melbourne Methodist Homes they studied also had staffing issues during the Second World War.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>There were several social dynamics that were leading to the shortage of staff. During World War Two the need for female labour due to men being overseas would have contributed to the staff shortages. The ability of the Government to ‘manpower’ women for essential services was also a problem, St Mary’s attempted unsuccessfully to get children’s homes made an essential industry in an effort to keep staff.<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The period from 1940 to 1970 saw remarkably low rates of unemployment in New Zealand, around one percent of the labour force in 1961.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> This meant that workers could take their pick of jobs and domestic work in a children’s homes may not have held the same attraction as it did in the interwar period when unemployment was much higher.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> There were also more career options opening for women. Although these were limited compared to later periods, more secondary education for girls and the increasing professionalisation of jobs like nursing and teaching gave women more attractive options. Also young people wanted more freedom than the live-in positions allowed. Residential staff had to work evenings and weekends, which could affect the social lives of young, single staff members.<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Another social dynamic operating in post-war New Zealand was near-universal marriage at an early age.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> This meant that the pool of unmarried women that had existed in previous generations to staff places like children’s homes had shrunk.</p>
<p>It proved impossible to trace all the staff that were employed at the All Saints’ Children’s Home. It is, however, feasible to get an idea of what types of women were employed from remaining records. A reasonable amount is known about some Matrons and staff, and it was possible to interview two surviving staff members, one from the late 1940s and another from the late 1950s. Typically the employees seem to have shared a lack of male financial support. Most of the women who worked in the Home were single, the only married Matron beginning work in 1925. Anne Wagstaff not only had a husband but at least two children.<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> It is unclear whether Mr Wagstaff had a job, but he was asked to perform handyman jobs around the Home.<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Long-serving single women include Annie Foley, the second Matron and the longest serving, working in the Home for eleven years, from 1907 until 1918. Other examples include: Dorothy Bellingham, sub-matron from 1936 to 1938 and Matron from 1938 to 1946; Lucy Elliot, Matron from 1950-1957; and Miss Wallace, assistant 1940 to 1946 and Matron from 1946-1948.</p>
<p>There are probably several reasons why the staff were predominantly single women. These women presumably needed to support themselves, their parents being unable to support them in the family home. They may have started their working life with children or as domestics as this was seen as ideal way for them to practise for their eventual role as wife and mother.<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Single women who did not get married then made a career out of caring for children. Another aspect that would have made work in children’s home attractive to single women was that it gave them somewhere safe to live. Particularly before World War Two, it was difficult for single women to find safe and respectable accommodation outside of a family home. By taking live-in positions they had a wage and a bed.</p>
<p>Another group of women that needed to earn their own money were widows and separated women with children. Work in children’s homes would have been attractive to them because the homes were often able to accommodate their children. This meant that the women could support themselves without having to worry about finding care for their children. Alice Farrell was a widow with a child and was employed sometime between 1922 and 1924.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> There are two examples of Matrons who were widows and whose older daughters acted as assistants, Mrs Spensley<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and Mrs Bain.<a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The first record of the Home employing a separated woman is in 1943, when Mrs Stokes was appointed as cook. She brought her two daughters with her and Mr Stokes paid for their maintenance.<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> We cannot know what the Committee’s attitude towards separated women was, but it is probable that they could not be fussy as the labour market tightened.<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> This would have been exacerbated by the fact that live-in positions were more attractive to separated women with children than to single women who wanted their evenings and weekends to socialise. Employment within the Home provided a way of women supporting themselves. It was particularly important for women with children who found themselves without male support, as it enabled them to keep their families together.</p>
<p>Another circumstance that a number of employees in the Home shared was that they were recent immigrants to New Zealand. Alice Farrell was an English immigrant arriving in New Zealand in 1922; and she left her employment to return there.<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Both Anne Wagstaff and Mrs Bain arrived in New Zealand in the year before they took up their jobs.<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Mrs Bain chose New Zealand because her son had a place at Flock House.<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Miss Bellingham arrived in New Zealand in 1927 and left her position as Matron to return there in 1946.<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> After the Second World War, the Home began employing recent migrants from Europe. In 1949 the first application was made to the Labour Department for a displaced person with a child. She arrived at the Home within the fortnight.<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> In September 1951 Mrs Kerylas, a Latvian, was employed,<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> and in 1952 the Home sponsored the immigration of a Dutch woman, also with a child, who began employment in September 1952.<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> In 1958 Edith von Moerkerken arrived from Holland to work at the Home. Her job had been arranged by her sister while Edith was still in Holland, as she could not enter New Zealand without the offer of a job. She spoke very little English but recalls that the children were very patient with her.<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> It seems that the Home provided an initial step on the employment ladder for recent immigrants. The fact that the Home provided accommodation and would allow employees’ children to live with them meant that it was an appealing option as a first job for those newly arrived in New Zealand. The migrants’ need for a job and a place to live was matched by the Home’s need for staff, particularly after World War Two when residential staff were getting very difficult to find.</p>
<p>The single women, separated or widowed mothers and the new immigrants who were employed in the Home could be vulnerable to exploitation. Yet the staff were able to exercise agency within their situations to advance their own conditions, get attention for their grievances, or improve the life of the children. The most common way of staff exerting agency was by threatening to resign. The first recorded incident of this was in 1915 when the sub-matron, Miss Knight tendered her resignation. It is not apparent what her grievance was but it probably had something to do with the duties she was expected to perform. The Ladies’ Committee convinced her to withdraw her resignation by setting up an enquiry into the workings of the Home.<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1949 a disagreement arose between the Ladies’ Committee and the Matron. The nature of this is unclear, but in July a meeting of the Vicar, the Treasurer, the Secretary and three members of the Ladies’ committee resolved to remove the Matron as soon as a replacement could be found.<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The result of this was the resignation of the entire staff,<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> presumably siding with the Matron. Both these examples of staff using withdrawal of their labour came at a time when there were plenty of jobs available. Not only would it have been easy for the staff leaving to find new jobs, but it was also harder for the Home to find replacement staff, meaning that the Ladies’ Committee would have been more disposed to negotiate.</p>
<p>Another way that the staff could exercise agency was through purchases made for the Home. The Matron was meant to seek approval for every purchase she made, other than groceries. From the late 1940s onwards Matrons did not always do so, risking the disapproval of the Ladies’ Committee. Lucy Elliot, Matron from 1950 to 1957, was told several times to stop purchasing goods without permission,<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> but continued to do so. It seems that Matron was more interested in attending to the needs of the children in a timely fashion, than following the rules. The Ladies’ Committee were forced to accept this as the employment climate of the 1950s meant that staff were hard to replace.</p>
<p>During the life of the Home the numbers of employees changed with availability and it was not always possible to maintain ideal numbers of staff. This was particularly true in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the Child Welfare Department pressed the Home to increase its staff-to-child ratio. Because it was difficult to find residential staff, the number of daily staff increased, and the number of children accepted into the home decreased. The reduction of children can be seen as a sign that staff were difficult to find. Most of the women who worked in the Home were without male support, either single, widowed or separated. Before World War Two, the Home was a valuable form of employment for unmarried women due to the work being socially acceptable as well as providing a respectable live-in position. Changes in post-war society meant that residential work became less appealing to unmarried women and the higher marriage rates led to less single women being available. Widowed and separated women sought employment in the Home because it enabled a woman in this situation to support herself without having to find childcare. Immigrants, particularly those with children, were also drawn to employment in the Home as it enabled them to earn a living without having to find other accommodation. Even though the typical staff member may have had little power, they were still able to exercise agency, particularly when there was a buoyant job market. The type of employment the All Saints’ Children’s Home offered filled an important role in the social fabric by providing a means for women without male support to earn a living.</p>
