         <h1>Chapter 7: Life in the Home</h1>
         <p><p><em>’We have so many memories of our time at the Home’<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p>
<p>So far much of this thesis has been dominated by the story of the All Saints’ Children’s Home as told in official documents and newspapers. In this chapter the voice of those who were children in the Home is heard. Twelve former children were interviewed, the range of their stays dating from 1938 to a child who was at the Home when it closed. One of these children has also written her memories and provided a copy. It was also possible to access an oral history interview with an ex-child who was in the Home from 1917 until 1928 and some memories another ex-child left for her family. These form the basis of this chapter about life in the Home. It starts by discussing some of the issues around the use of oral history and memory, focusing on how the material was used to build a picture of life in the Home, beginning with children entering the Home and how siblings were treated. What ex-children remember about the routines in Home is explored, including chores, school and food. Corporal punishment is a feature that many ex-children remember from their stays in children’s homes,<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the interview subjects each had a different view on how this was dealt with at All Saints’. The children were not passive and their efforts to resist what they saw as poor or unfair treatment will be examined, both from their memories, and from the Board and Ladies’ Committee Minutes. In 1942 the Trust Board completed a holiday home in the Kahuterawa Valley, near Palmerston North, called Brown House after the family that donated the land.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> All the interviewees that holidayed there remember these times as being very happy and some of the memories of those holidays are recounted. There were also other treats, with picnics and Christmas time featuring in all the interviews. Lastly, what happened to the children once they left the home is considered, looking first at boys and then girls. Although each interview presented different memories and views of the Home, together they build a picture of what life was like for the children in the All Saints’ Children’s Home.</p>
<p>Even though some of the children’s stays overlap, the stories and memories each ex-child had of the Home are unique. When reading and processing each interview it was important to remember that each child’s experience of the Home is their personal story: it is how they remember their stay. The stories may replicate, corroborate, or contradict each other, but they all contribute to an understanding of what a childhood spent in All Saints’ Children’s Home was like.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In the following accounts of Home life an effort has been made to draw on all the experiences that the interview subjects recounted. Some subjects were positive about their time in the Home. Some believed that although the Home was not ideal they were better off than some other children, or that they would have been worse off had they stayed with their families. Some were negative about the Home and the treatment they received, recalling abuse and humiliation. The purpose of this chapter is not to present a definitive account of life in the Home, but to explore the experience of those who were willing speak about their life as a child in the All Saints’ Home.</p>
<p>Not all the interview participants remember their entry to the Home. Some were too young and others simply did not recall it. The common theme of those children that remember is that entry into the Home seemed to be sudden and surprising. Graham Herdman remembers that he and his siblings had no preparation and it was very hard on his younger brother who didn’t understand what was happening and wanted to go home.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Charles Colson was taken to the Home by his mother’s doctor and he quickly found that there was a pecking order among the boys.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Owen White, the youngest of four siblings admitted in 1955, recalls that he went to the Home with his mother and grandmother in a taxi. The Home seemed very big to him, but the presence of his older siblings helped him to cope.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Howard Ellington remembers that he arrived at lunch time and was taken to the dining room: his main memory is of being very anxious.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> These types of memories seem to be common among those admitted to homes. Crawford documenting thirty-seven recollections of entering children’s homes or orphanages notes that the feelings of children were seldom considered and that for children used to life in a family home the size and number of children in a home could be overwhelming.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Another feature of life in children’s homes was the strict separation of boys and girls. For those that entered with siblings, this could mean that they lost contact. Some homes were only for girls or boys so siblings could be sent to different homes, but All Saints’ accepted both genders. However, they were kept quite separate and, as boys were sent to Sedgley between the age of ten and twelve, this further disconnected siblings. Eight of the interviewees had gender-opposite siblings in the Home at the same time. In two of the cases the siblings were younger brothers who were quickly fostered or were in and out of the Home periodically. The two participants from the late 1930s and 1940s reported the most dislocation from siblings. Clive Shaw does not remember his older sisters in the Home at all.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Mavis Hunt was never encouraged to think of her three brothers as siblings, but just as other boys in the Home.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Her younger brother, Bernard, felt the same and that the removal of the boys to Sedgley aggravated this.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Those that were in the Home during the 1950s did not feel the same way, and had positive memories about the support that their siblings offered while they were in the Home.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> This change possibly began with the arrival of Lucy Elliot as Matron in 1950 and may have ended when she left at the end of 1957. One of the participants who was in the Home during the early 1960s had no memory of his sister being there at the same time, despite the fact that another, female, interviewee does.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The practice of separating siblings was common in homes. Penglase points out that there appears to be no rationale for this, and it could add to the trauma of entering a home.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Although All Saints’ accepted families, it seems that the practice of keeping boys and girls separate did not encourage the maintenance of family bonds.</p>
<p>Running an institution with upwards of thirty children meant that the Matron and staff had to run the Home in an organised manner. This was a very common theme that emerged, with the word most often used when asked to describe routines in the Home being ‘regimented’, Bernard Walker adding that it was ‘run on army lines’.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Louis Braddock, who was in the Home during the 1920s and left an oral history, recalled the use of bells to signal meals.<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Mavis Hunt also remembers bells, and that children had jobs to do before and after breakfast, which they had to be quick at or they would be late for school.<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Those children from the late 1950 and early 1960s also remember the use of bells to signal wake up times<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and meals, but not those from the early and mid 1950s.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Again, this matches with the time that Lucy Elliot was Matron, and, as will be further discussed, she appears to have had a less authoritarian approach to running the Home.</p>
<p>The use of rosters to allocate chores was also something ex-children commonly remembered. The labour of the children in the Home was important to the smooth running, especially since it could be hard to find staff. The Christensen sisters recalled that jobs would be rotated so that each child got to learn the different tasks.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> All the children remembered different chores they had. The common household chores, like dishes, table setting and meal preparation appeared to have been done by all the children. Girls remember having to dress the younger ones, help with laundry and cut lunches, whereas boys remember mowing lawns, window cleaning, and keeping the boiler going. Clive Shaw was three when he entered the Home, and he remembers boys cutting the lawns and cleaning the ablutions, but he was too young to participate.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Both Mavis Hunt and Christine Ramsey remember it was their job to prepare the cut lunches for school, despite a separation of twenty years between their stays.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Polishing shoes was another common chore, both the Walkers remember this as being the boys’ job,<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> but the Christensens recall that it was shared between boys and girls.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The Child Welfare Office inspections also record what domestic duties were expected of the children. The reports from the 1930s note that nothing was expected of children under ten, or while of school age.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> By 1940 this had changed,<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and in 1952 the local Child Welfare Officer wrote to the Board to tell them he believed that the Matron was doing too much work herself and she should be asking more of the older children.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> As was shown in Chapter [EmploymentOfStaffForTheHome] the Home had problems finding and retaining staff during and after the Second World War. It seems that one way of dealing with staff shortages was to use the labour of the children. The 1961 Child Welfare Report states that only the older children had specific duties,<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> signalling that the number of domestic chores expected from the children had lessened. This also coincides with an increase in the number of staff employed.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>When asked to recall what going to school was like, two themes emerged: the distance the children had to walk and the way they were treated. When the Board opened the Home in Pascal Street, one of the disadvantages of its location was its distance, just over a kilometre, from the local public school, Central School. Mavis Hunt remembers that the children had so many chores to do in the morning that they often had to run to get to school in time. The distance was magnified by the fact that the children returned to the Home for lunch, and once again it was a rush as they were expected to eat lunch and get chores done before returning to school.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Jim Kelly, who was at Central School during the late 1930s, remembers the children from the Home leaving for lunch and thought the practice was unfair as it separated the Home children from their peers and meant that they could not join in the lunchtime play, or make friends.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The practice of coming home for lunch was changed in the late 1940s, and during the 1950s the children’s lunches were sent to school in a suitcase at some time during the morning. Caroline Judkins recalls that this marked out the children from the Home and led to teasing.<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Being singled out as different was another memory of school. Mavis Hunt, Howard Ellington and Diana Merron felt that Home children were regarded as ‘bad kids’ and that they were treated with suspicion.<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The girls remember that their clothes marked them out as different. Caroline Judkins recalled that all the children were given grey shirts to wear to school, when these were generally considered to be for boys only.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Others didn’t have the same feelings, but all remember that they were given the label ‘Home kids’ and were obviously different from the other children.<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Food often features in recollections about children’s homes. Crawford has a whole chapter on her participants’ memories, noting in the introduction that porridge was a staple breakfast in most institutions.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> All Saints’ was no exception. All the ex-children mentioned porridge and from the 1950s the children were also offered Weetbix, which was donated by the Sanitarium factory at Longburn.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The food was mostly described as bland, with Mavis Hunt giving the examples of stews, tripe and onions, shepherds’ pie, usually followed by a milk pudding.<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Those that were in the Home in the 1940s remember that only the staff were allowed butter, and Louis Braddock also mentions that during the 1920s the children didn’t have butter.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> ‘Crunch’, bread left to dry out in the oven over night, was also a feature of the 1950s and 1960s. Opinion was mixed about whether the children had enough food. Graham Herdman and Charles Colson were in the Home at the same time. Charles remembers being hungry all the time, yet Graham recalls that there was enough food.<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In the early 1960s, Howard Ellington and Diana Merron both remember that they were hungry, yet Keran Osgood, who was also in the Home during the same period, believed he never went without.<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> As was mentioned in Chapter [HowTheHomeWasSupported], the Home was very reliant on donations so it is possible that the amount of food fluctuated depending on the season. Diana remembers the harvest festivals, which occurred in March and April, as being a time when there was more food than normal.<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Children in institutions can be targets for abuse and children’s homes in New Zealand have had claims of cruel treatment brought against them.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> A clear pattern emerges from the children whose memories have formed the basis of this chapter, that the use of corporal, and particularly cruel, punishment was dependent upon the staff in the Home.<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The children that were in the Home during the time when Lucy Elliot was Matron, 1950 to 1957, all reported that there was no corporal punishment. This contrasts with those children in the Home either side of these dates, of whom all but one remembered having been physically punished and seeing others treated likewise. It is difficult to tell whether the use of corporal punishment was the official policy of the Board, but several of the boys said that the strap was ‘part of the deal’ and that school was worse.<a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The only insight into the attitude that the Home authorities had comes from an incident that occurred in 1928. Mr Wagstaff, the husband of the Matron, had administered corporal punishment to a boy, who subsequently ran away. After much discussion, the Board decided to implement a rule that no corporal punishment was to be given without the express consent of the Vicar.<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>The testimony from two ex-children of the 1940s shows this rule had fallen by the wayside during their time. Della Macpherson told her daughter of the beatings that she received at the hands of one staff member, and her continued fear of this staff member almost prevented Della from attending the 1990 reunion.<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Mavis Hunt recalled having corporal punishment used on her and witnessed another girl being beaten with a coat hanger.<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Bed-wetting was often punished in children’s homes and both Mavis and Charles remember that the staff were horrible to bed wetters,<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> but Clive Shaw does not remember being punished for wetting the bed, possibly because he was still young.<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Withdrawal of privileges was also used as punishment and seemed to be the way the Lucy Elliot dealt with bad behaviour. Those who were children during her time reported punishments like removal of pocket money and other treats.<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Those children that experienced life in the Home under Lucy used the words firm and fair to describe her.<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Two of the participants from the late 1950s and early 1960s recall that after Lucy left corporal punishment was used as well as other forms of discipline, like withholding meals and locking in cupboards.<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>In the early 1960s Ken Gregory, the principal of Takaro School, where the children had gone since its opening in 1957, became concerned about the reports he was receiving from teachers. The children were coming to school hungry and bruised, so he complained to the Board and Child Welfare.<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> He subsequently went on the Board, and began helping in the Home during the evenings.<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Two children also remember being fed at school, one of them commenting that ‘Mr Gregory gave them white bread.’<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> It seems that towards the end of the Home’s life, the staff may have been resorting to much harsher punishments than in Matron’s Elliot’s time.</p>
<p>Although the power balance between children and staff was very heavily weighted in favour of the staff, this did not stop children from trying to resist unfair or cruel treatment. Mavis Hunt remembers the girl beaten with a coat hanger climbing out on to the fire escape and threatening to jump. Mavis herself ran away from a family that the Home had placed her with as she felt that she was being used as a domestic slave.<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> There are several incidents recorded in the Ladies’ Committee Minutes and Matron’s Day book that document the active resistance of children. In April 1961 several children ran away,<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> one of whom became a repeat absconder.<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Eventually she was discharged to her mother.<a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Also in 1961, two girls were caught stealing from a local shop and sent to bed without tea. They then proceeded to cut up a mattress.<a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Owen White remembers that he and another boy were caught throwing stones at the Matron. She tried to strap Owen, but was prevented by another boy intervening and threatening physical violence against her.<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Most of the recorded incidents of children actively resisting staff came from the late 1950s and early 1960s. Mavis’s recollections shows that it is possible that children had been resisting earlier on in the life of the Home, but these incidents were not recorded in the official documents.</p>
<p>As discussed above, in 1942 the Board completed a holiday Home in the Kahuterawa Valley called Brown House. All the participants who holidayed there had very positive memories of those times. Initially, it was erected to provide an evacuation place for the children during the Second World War,<a href="#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> but it quickly became the site of holidays for the children. In the 1940s and possibly up to the mid-1950s, the children were taken on the back of a truck.<a href="#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Children from the later period remember going in a bus.<a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Mavis Hunt recalled that Brown House was more relaxed and there was less work to do.<a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Other common memories were of swimming: several children recalled learning to swim and two remembered incidents where someone nearly drowned.<a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> It seems that Lucy Elliot went out of her way to make Brown House a fun place to be, making a fairy dell in the bush and taking the children on long walks.<a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The Shere family, who farmed nearby, took a special interest in the children, allowing them to help with farm work and one ex-child remembers being taught to ride a horse.<a href="#fn70" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Catching eels in the local stream was another common memory and there are some surviving photographs of children showing off their catch.<a href="#fn71" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The tradition of going to rural areas for long summer holidays seems to have been held at other Homes. Morris Matthews has descriptions of similar holidays in her chapters on the Otane<a href="#fn72" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and Waipawa Homes.<a href="#fn73" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Like the All Saints’ children, the children from these Homes remember their holidays as being part of the ‘good times’ at the Home.</p>

<p><img src="Pictures/BrownHouseTruck.jpg" alt="image" width="718" /></p>
<p>Brown House was not the only treat that children experienced. The most commonly remembered special times revolved around Christmas. Howard Ellington called Christmas ‘the best time’<a href="#fn74" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> and Caroline Judkins remembered it as exciting.<a href="#fn75" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> From the earliest oral history interview, with Louis Braddock, he remembered that at Christmas the Commercial Travellers’ Association took the children to the tea rooms at Collinson and Cunninghame’s, a local department store. Children from the late 1940s onwards remembered getting presents. Graham Herdman had his in a pillowcase at the end of his bed,<a href="#fn76" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> while the Christensen sisters recalled decorating a paper bag on Christmas Eve, which would be filled with presents the next day.<a href="#fn77" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> These presents were donated or bought with donated money. The Ladies’ Committee minutes record donations for ‘Christmas Cheer,’ for example in December 1948 donations were asked for and in December 1954 Matron was given permission to spend twenty pounds on the children’s Christmas presents.<a href="#fn78" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Other special treats included visitsto the movies and theatre, sometimes with tickets donated by the movie theatre,<a href="#fn79" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> sometimes by individuals<a href="#fn80" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> or service clubs.<a href="#fn81" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Louis Braddock recalls going to movies often but was not sure who paid.<a href="#fn82" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Diana Merron remembered being taken to see movies and theatre performances, more than she would have done had she remained with her family.<a href="#fn83" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> The Commercial Travellers also held a picnic for the children at Foxton Beach for many years.<a href="#fn84" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> This may have been something that the Association organised in other centres, as one of Crawford’s oral history participants mentions them.<a href="#fn85" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> It seems that Christmas is remembered by most ex-children with pleasure because that was the time of the year when the Home received many donations and help from the community.</p>
<p>When the time came for children to leave the Home, boys and girls were treated quite differently. Under the first constitution the Home had control of the children until they were sixteen or handed over to their parents.<a href="#fn86" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> It seems from the Board minutes that boys were not expected to stay in the Home until they were sixteen and were likely to be placed on a farm from the age of twelve. The first boy was placed with a farmer in Kairanga in 1912. The farmer was to provide board and clothing in return for what work the boy was able to do outside school hours.<a href="#fn87" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The practice of placing boys on farms continued, but by 1929 it was at age 14, when they had left school.<a href="#fn88" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> A 1936 return to the Child Welfare Office showed that four boys were working on farms but were still under the supervision of the Home.<a href="#fn89" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> This is despite the relationship that had begun with Sedgley in the late 1920s.<a href="#fn90" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The last record of a boy being placed on a farm appears in June 1938, but there is no record of his age.<a href="#fn91" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> From this point forward boys either left the Home to go to Sedgley or were discharged to their parents. This is confirmed by the 1939 Child Welfare Inspection, which states that the provision for placing boys after care was transferred to the Senior Church Home (Sedgley).<a href="#fn92" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, girls were able to stay in the Home much longer, and were more likely to be placed in higher education. The first mention of a girl receiving an education beyond primary school was in 1914, when a free place at the technical school was sought for a fourteen-year-old girl.<a href="#fn93" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> In 1916 the Board decided to raise the age at which children passed out of its control, wanting to control boys to sixteen and girls to eighteen. For some reason the original resolution affecting girls only was crossed out and replaced with ‘children’.<a href="#fn94" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> This was possibly a response to the oldest girl in the Home having turned sixteen in December of 1915,<a href="#fn95" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> but it is unclear if it was an attempt to protect her, or to prevent her, from leaving. This concern for keeping girls under the control of homes for longer than boys was also noted by Tennant.<a href="#fn96" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>Another way in which girls were treated differently was when they came to leave the Home. Girls were expected to become domestic servants and one way the Home had of ‘training’ them was to enforce a year, or sometimes two, of service to the Home. These girls were described as house-girls and the first record of one appears in a 1916 Child Welfare Office inspection.<a href="#fn97" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Morris Matthews found a similar scheme operated at Randall House, one of the Hawke’s Bay Children’s Homes.<a href="#fn98" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> From the ages in the government statistical returns, it appears that the 1930s was when this practice was most common, as from 1931 until 1940 the Home housed at least one girl over 15, apart from in the years 1933 and 1939.<a href="#fn99" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> In 1937 the local Child Welfare Officer wrote to the Superintendent of Child Welfare, John Beck, expressing concern about house-girls. She noted that there were three girls ‘working out’ two years of service. These girls had no regular time off and were not allowed to socialise, apart from going to church services.<a href="#fn100" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Beck subsequently wrote to the Board stating the desirability of allowing children to attend regular social activities outside of the Home and of providing secondary education where ability was shown.<a href="#fn101" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>The practice continued, with two house-girls being appointed in 1940.<a href="#fn102" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> In 1942 one girl was appointed house-girl, but allowed to take dress-making classes, while another girl was taking a the full domestic course at the Technical School.<a href="#fn103" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> At the beginning of 1943 Matron asked for an older girl to be retained as a house-girl. The Committee refused her request, saying that they believed it was in the best interests of the girls to be sent to St Mary’s Home in Karori.<a href="#fn104" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> No reason was given for this decision and it was not in keeping with past practice or with what happened in 1944, when it was decided to keep a girl at the Home to help while she attended dress-making classes at the technical school.<a href="#fn105" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Another house-girl was appointed in 1945,<a href="#fn106" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> but she was sent to St Mary’s in June as she was proving troublesome.<a href="#fn107" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> There was only one other house-girl appointed: in July 1948 the oldest girl in the Home left school and was employed as a ‘junior assistant’.<a href="#fn108" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> This ended when she ran off with a boy at the end of 1948.<a href="#fn109" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The practice probably ceased due to the changing expectations around girls’ employment, although the amount of trouble older girls seemed to be causing may have had some influence.</p>
<p>It was becoming apparent during the 1940s that the girls would not continue to go into domestic service once they left the Home. This is demonstrated by the move in the 1940s to let girls take domestic courses or dress-making courses at the technical high school. There was also an effort to place girls with dressmakers.<a href="#fn110" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Another issue that the Ladies’ Committee and Board had to contend with was the rise in the school-leaving age to fifteen and the expectation that girls would continue on to high school for at least some secondary education. Mavis Hunt was the first girl from the Home to complete her secondary education. She recalls having to fight for permission to stay at school. She eventually became a teacher.<a href="#fn111" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> The reluctance to keep girls at school is demonstrated in the minutes, when, in 1945, a fourteen-year-old girl wished to go to high school and the decision required some discussion.<a href="#fn112" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> By the early 1950s it was routine for the girls to go to high school, and one girl was allowed to begin work at the hospital.<a href="#fn113" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> As explained in Chapter [TheChildrenAndFamiliesOfTheHome], during the 1950s the girls in the Home were slightly older. This trend is reflected in the proposal made in 1958 that the girls be allowed to stay in the Home indefinitely until they could ‘stand on their own two feet.’<a href="#fn114" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> One example of how the Home helped an older girl was to supplement her board at a private home,<a href="#fn115" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> and when she moved into a flat the Ladies’ Committee Secretary visited her.<a href="#fn116" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> As societal expectations around the employment of women changed, the Board and Ladies’ Committee had to adapt their expectations of what would happened to the girls once they left the Home.</p>
<p>Each story represented in this Chapter shows a slightly different aspect of life in the All Saints’ Children’s Home. Not all children remember entering the Home, but they remembered that routines were important, and that there were many chores to be done. Most of the children felt singled out at school and experienced various levels of teasing and ostracisation. Memories about food vary, but some common themes were the prevalence of porridge and the plain nature of the food served. Not all the children in the Home saw or experienced corporal punishment. The levels of discipline and punishment experienced were dependent on the staff in the Home, and some resisted staff attempts to control them. All the children, even those who were negative about the Home, remembered that there were good times, including holidays at Brown House and other treats, like Christmas, movies, theatre performances and picnics. When it came time for children to leave the Home, boys and girls had very different experiences, with the Home more concerned about girls and more active in training them for their future lives. From entering the Home, to what routine life was like, chores, school food and punishment, each ex-child’s memories helped to build a picture of the life of a child of the All Saints’ Children’s Home.</p>
