         <h1>Chapter 8: The Relationship Between the Home and the Government</h1>
         <p><p><em>’Altogether this home is, in my opinion, well conducted.’<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p>
<p>The relationship that children’s homes had with the Government was full of contradictions. On the one hand, the Government was officially opposed to children being in institutions. On the other, there is clear evidence they made use of children’s homes and that they were part of the network of child welfare the Government relied on. The information for this chapter was mostly taken from two sources: the Board and Ladies’ Committee Minutes, and the Child Welfare Branch’s All Saints’ Home Administration File. At present it is not possible to access the files of individual Child Welfare Offices due to privacy issues. The inability to view the Palmerston North Office File has meant that the information in this chapter is somewhat piecemeal. However, one of the oral history participants, Diana Merron, had a copy of her personal Child Welfare file, which she very kindly shared and the Christensen sister shared some of the details of their experiences with the Child Welfare Office. This chapter begins by looking at the official relationship between the Home and the Government and explores instances when the Home came to the notice of the State, including matters that arose from annual inspections. The Ladies’ Committee Minutes also contain many references to Child Welfare and some of these will be examined to try and understand how the Government may have used the Home. It was very hard to come to any firm conclusion about the relationship between the Government and the Home because most of the available information was from the viewpoint of the Home.</p>
<p>The first recorded interaction between the Home and a government department took place before the Home opened. As part of the preparation for the opening of the Home, Rev. Harper wrote to the Education Department to ask if the Home could accept children committed by the Courts and whether the Department could ask parents if they wished to have their children sent to the Home.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In December 1906 the Department replied that they could not allow industrial school children to be sent to the Home.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Again, in 1907, Harper wrote to the Ministry asking if the Government could grant the Home any assistance, as it did for similar institutions.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The Education Department passed the request on to the Inspector-General of Hospitals and Charitable Institutions for his consideration.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The outcome is not recorded in the Child Welfare file, but in the August 1908 <em>Church Chronicle</em> a letter appears from Harper, asking for support and stating that he had tried to get government support.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The reason that the Government was reluctant to give financial support to the Home is best expressed in a 1908 memorandum in the All Saints’ Home Administration File. Written by Roland Pope, the Assistant-Inspector of Industrial Schools, it gives three reasons why private homes were not admitted to the Industrial School system and were therefore not eligible for government funds. These were that the definite policy of the Government for the past twenty-five years had been to foster children, whereas private institutions did not foster and wished to keep their children ‘under one roof.’ Private institutions were under financial stresses which prevented the children from receiving the care and attention they needed to overcome the handicap of their early lives. Finally, private homes tended to be denominational in nature and this would ‘undermine the moral training in the industrial school system.’<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> This memorandum summarises the Government’s attitude towards private homes: they provided care of an inferior quality.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> At the heart of the issue was the Education Department’s belief that boarding-out or foster care was the most beneficial method of caring for children.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Children’s homes were seen as being institutions and therefore not using the ‘best’ forms of care.</p>
<p>The main formal interactions between the Home and Government were the annual inspections. From 1908 until 1927 these were conducted under the Infant Life Protection Act, 1907. Under this Act all homes, foster or institutional, that accepted children under the age of six, had to be licensed. In May 1908 All Saints’ Home gained an exemption from the Act by agreeing to be open at all times to the Education Department’s inspectors.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Inspections appear to have been conducted annually from 1908 until 1916.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> After the 1916 inspection report there are none on the file. It is unclear whether inspections ceased or the reports did not survive. In general the reports were favourable, the only complaint coming in 1915 when the inspector thought the the ‘water-closets’ were dirty and needed moving.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The Board minutes record that this was done in May 1916.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>When John Beck took Pope’s place as head of the Special School Section in 1916,<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> he began agitating for more state control over children’s homes. In 1918 he wrote to the Director of Education that ‘social services connected with the various churches are allowed to exploit and experiment with the child life of this young country, and all without any effective state supervision whatsoever,’<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Beck’s ideas about child welfare were embodied in the 1925 Child Welfare Act, for which he was largely responsible. It was a major overhaul of government provision of child welfare, and established the Child Welfare Branch within the Education Department. However, Beck was not able to get any legislative control over children’s homes. In his 1926 report to Government he said that he regretted the omission and maintained that ‘There is a very great need for the co-ordination and for the adoption of modern standards’.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Beck was successful in 1927, when an amendment to the 1925 Act made registration and annual inspection of private institutions mandatory.<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The first inspection of All Saints’ under the 1927 Act occurred in 1928.<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> There was also one in 1929, but there are none in the records from 1930 to 1935. Again, it is unclear as to whether these were not undertaken due to the Depression or not filed, but there are records of inspections every year from 1936 until 1958. As with the inspections under the Infant Life Protection Act, there were no major faults found with the Home. The main criticisms focused on the condition of the building.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> For example there was a long saga about the suitability of the fire escapes in the 1950s.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In 1939 and 1943 there were some concerns voiced by the inspecting officers about the amount of butter the Home was using not being enough for each child to be receiving the recommended daily amount.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Both times the Ladies’ Committee Secretary assured the Child Welfare Branch that they had increased the amount and in 1943 it was said to be low due to there being a number of ‘tiny-tots’.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> It is interesting to note that one of the ex-children from this period remembered that the children were not allowed butter,<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> so it is possible that the amount was low because the children were not being given butter to eat. The only instance of the Child Welfare Branch inspections commenting on the way the children were treated is the 1937 criticism of the house-girls, mentioned in Chapter [LifeInTheHome]. It seems probable that the inspectors came on week-days when the children were at school and therefore only saw those children that were under school age, although it is not possible to know this for certain.</p>
<p>There were, however, two records of complaints from others about the way children from the Home were treated. The first came in 1924, from Elizabeth Gunn, the local School Medical Officer. The Headmaster of the school the children from the Home went to at the time, College Street, had complained that the children were poorly clad, not clean and had head lice. Gunn had examined them and found this to be true and that some of the children were also carrying diphtheria.<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This prompted a visit to the Home by two officers of the Special School Branch who found that the Home was run down and overcrowded and the food was inadequate.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> This report resulted in the Matron’s services ‘being dispensed with’<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and the follow-up inspection in March 1926 reported a ‘good deal of improvement has been effected’,<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> so it is possible that the problems were due to the Matron.</p>
<p>The second complaint to the Government about the Home was regarding the treatment of children still under its control, but out working. It seems that sometime in 1936 a girl placed in service had been badly treated. In October 1936 Miss Jenkins, a Child Welfare Officer, wrote to Beck mentioning that she had taken the case to the police,<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and in December the Board and Ladies’ Committee had a combined meeting at which they discussed the case.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> However, in November an ex-school teacher wrote to Peter Fraser, who was Minister of Education, complaining about the treatment of children that were placed out from the Home. These children had come to her attention while she was a school teacher in a rural area near Pongaroa. It appears from the letter that she was generally concerned about the placement of children on farms, but she had one person in particular she wished to complain about, a Mrs L.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> It is unclear if these two incidents are related, as the girl living with Mrs L is not named.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> These complaints led both the Child Welfare Office and the Home authorities to keep a closer eye on the children who had been placed.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>So far this chapter has examined the official relationship between the Home and the Government. There was, however, much more to the interactions between the Home and the State than the official file on the Home reveals. From the Ladies’ Committee Minutes it is possible to ascertain some of the ways the Home was used by Child Welfare. As has already been discussed, officially Child Welfare believed that boarding out was the best way to care for children. However, this belief did not prevent them from using children’s homes, like All Saints’, as part of their network of care. As Somerville notes, this was particularly true in the inter-war period, when the State needed the Homes or it would have been overwhelmed with the number of children needing care.<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The Child Welfare Branch may have used the Home at times when it was unable to find alternatives, or its own facilities were full.<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> There is one record of this occurring at All Saints’ when in 1960 they were asked to house a girl until the new Receiving Home was built.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In the cases discussed below the reason for the placement of the children, or even the level of involvement of Child Welfare is largely unknown. The information is gathered mainly from the Ladies’ Committee Minutes and there is no available information on the reasoning behind the action of the Child Welfare Branch.</p>
<p>There are several records of Child Welfare approaching the Home. In October 1938 the Home received an application from Miss Jenkins for six orphans from Foxton.<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The Home agreed to take three. In September 1942, Child Welfare approached the Home to take two children.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> This request was refused, but one to take a three-year-old boy was accepted in 1949.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> It is impossible to know why Child Welfare wanted to place these children in the Home and not board them out, as was their policy. The complexities of the interactions between the Home and Child Welfare Office are illustrated by family A. The A children were placed in the Home in July 1939, although there is no record of why they were placed in the Home.<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In May 1940 Mrs A wrote to the Ladies’ Committee asking if she could take them.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> This began a long correspondence which involved Mrs A, the Trust Board’s lawyer,<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> and the Child Welfare Office. In 1944 Child Welfare advised the Ladies’ Committee that on no account were the children to be taken by their mother.<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Finally in September 1948 the Secretary of the Ladies’ Committee reported on the details of the A children<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and they were discharged in October 1948, although to whom is not stated.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The details of this case are patchy, due to the Ladies Committee Minutes being the only source, but it is clear that for some reason Child Welfare was involved with this family.</p>
<p>The A’s were not the only family with which Child Welfare was involved, and the appearance of correspondence with Child Welfare Officers, or the decision to seek advice from Child Welfare is common in the Ladies Committee Minutes. What is unclear is whether families were in the Home because Child Welfare had placed the children or if the parents had placed the children because they were not coping with family pressures and Child Welfare had become involved. Penglase noted that sometimes parents would place their children in private homes to prevent their removal by the state, but it is impossible to know if this was a factor.<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>There are two families that were in the Home for which more about Child Welfare’s involvement is known. The Christensen girls were placed in the Home by Child Welfare in 1952. Their younger brother was placed in a foster home, and to this day they remain unclear as to why they were separated, or why the Welfare authorities chose to use the Home.<a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> In the case of Diana Merron’s family, they were placed in the Home in 1958 by their father, but the family had already come to the attention of Child Welfare as early as 1951.<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> From these two cases it appears that there were several factors at work. With the Christensens it seems that the Child Welfare Office made a conscious decision to use the Home. With Diana’s family it is probable that the problems that had originally brought her family to the attention of the authorities, combined with her mother’s death, had become too much for her father. Tennant points out that child welfare was one area where the boundaries between the State, families and voluntary organisations were particularly blurred.<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The small number of examples presented here add weight to this statement. However, without access to Child Welfare Office and family files it is very difficult to know whether the above stories are representative of many families in the Home or a few.</p>
<p>Even before the All Saints’ Children’s Home was opened, the Government had involvement with the Home. The 1907 Infant Life Protection Act opened the Home to government inspection and the 1927 Child Welfare Act amendment made annual inspection mandatory. On the whole, the annual inspections focused on the material aspects of the Home and very rarely mentioned the children. There were two instances of complaints about the way the children’s were treated, but it appears these were brought to the attention of government officials by members of the public. The Home was definitely used by the Child Welfare Branch to house children, despite the fact that institutions were officially considered to provide sub-standard care. Why Child Welfare may have used the Home remains largely unknown and until there is wider access to Child Welfare files the full relationship between Government and children’s homes will be difficult to assess.</p>
