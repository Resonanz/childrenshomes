<p><em>’The Trustees extend grateful thanks to all who have<br />
supported the Home during the past year’<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p>
<p>The All Saints’ Children’s Home was a charity, relying on the generosity of Palmerston North and surrounding districts for money and material goods. This chapter explores the financial situation of the Home and how this changed between its opening in 1906 and its closing in 1964. Annual accounts have survived from 1908 to 1914, 1916 and 1917, 1921 and 1926 to 1964. The financial year of the Home ran from April 1 to March 31, so the accounts are a largely reflection of the previous year. There is also valuable information about donations, legacies and expenditure in the Trust Board and Ladies’ Committee Minutes. Over the period the Home was open it had three main sources of monetary income, donations, parental contributions and government benefits (Figure [Income]). The sources of income, amounts, and the proportions are analysed in this chapter to see how income streams changed. The Home also relied on gifts in kind from the community. These were many and varied, but the nature of them and the amounts altered over the life of the Home. The amount it cost to run the Home could be problematic and income did not always meet expenditure. How the expenses shifted over the years is investigated here and placed in relation to what goods were being donated. Fundraising, which occasionally took the form of one-off campaigns and sometimes annual events, was important for the Home. Even the annual events had fads, some running for many years and then being replaced with new ideas. The general pattern was the amount of money people were prepared to give dropped as the Home aged, as did the quantity of goods that were donated, leading the Home to become dependant on government payments and legacies for its funding.</p>
<p>Initially the plans for the All Saints’ Children’s Home envisaged monetary funding from two sources, parental contributions and donations. In keeping with the early twentieth-century discourse around families, the Board believed it was important for parents to pay something toward the upkeep of their children to prevent parents using the Home to shirk their responsibilities.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> When the Home opened, the level was set at seven shillings a week, with discretion for the Board to decrease or waive fees on an as-needed basis. The 1909 Annual Report noted that it cost about fourteen pounds a year to keep a child in the Home, which equated to seven shillings a week. The report also said that there were four children in the Home for whom no payment was received and four for whom only a small amount was paid by parents.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This problem was compounded by parents who were able to pay but did not. The 1910 Annual Report stated that seven parents were in arrears. Considering the Home had twenty-one children, this is a large number not paying the full amount.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> From 1908 to 1914 the amount parents contributed dropped from an average of nine pounds per year per child to four pounds per year per child.</p>
<p>In 1916 the parental contributions suddenly increased, from £109 to £235. This could be explained by a number of factors: there could have been stricter enforcement by the Board.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The War had created a buoyant job market, so there could be more parents able to pay. Also, an increase in the amount parents were expected to pay possibly occurred about this time. In 1914 a girl was admitted, with her father to pay ten shillings a week,<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and in 1916, two families were admitted, each paying eight shillings a week, with one father to pay more when able. This suggests that eight shillings was below the normal rate.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>There is no clear record of any change in the amount parents were expected to pay each week, but ten shillings may have been the standard by 1916. Morris Mathews found that the France Trust was paying ten shillings per week for each child they sponsored in the Hawke’s Bay Children’s Home, suggesting this may have been the amount considered enough to support a child.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The amount parents were to pay was set at 12 shillings and 6 pence in 1921<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, but, apart from 1921, no financial records have survived from between 1917 and 1926, so it is difficult to tell if the trend of increased parental contributions continued.</p>
<p>The other stream of income was monetary donations. There were three types of money given to the Home: one-off donations, which included collections by various churches; people who pledged to give a fixed amount annually, called subscribers; and those that gave legacies or grants to the Home. The amount given to the Home in free-will monetary donations was variable in the period between 1908 and 1917. For the year ending March 1908, £99 in free-will donations were recorded, but the extensions to the building and the accompanying mortgage stretched the Home’s finances.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The Board decided to appeal for funds outside of the Palmerston North area. A letter from Rev. Harper appeared in the <em>Church Chronicle</em>, the Wellington Diocese newspaper, pointing out that All Saints’ Children’s Home served the whole of the Wellington Diocese and asking for people to subscribe to the Home.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> It seems that this campaign could have been successful as the amount donated in 1909 was £201<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and 1910 £222.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>However, the variable nature of donations is illustrated by a decrease in 1911 to £155<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and then a leap to £280 in 1912.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It is difficult to tell if the money was coming from within Palmerston North or from throughout the Wellington Diocese. One trend that did occur in this period was for churches in the Diocese to take up special offerings for the Children’s Home during their Christmas Service.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> This practice seems to have fallen off toward the end of World War One.<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The donation amount recorded in 1912 was the largest up to 1917, with the amount given trending downward.</p>
<p>The difficulty in relying on donations is reflected in the Annual Reports and Board Minutes, which repeatedly call for more subscribers. Subscriptions were seen as a more secure form of donations. A person would pledge to give a certain amount each year, set at a minimum of ten shillings, and, although the Board had no way of holding people to their pledge, most seem to have paid. In 1911 the financial position of the Home was described as ‘expenses stationary, income falling’<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and there was a call for more subscribers, which was repeated in 1912.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Even though subscriptions might be thought to be a more stable form of income, they proved as variable as donations. Between 1908 and 1917, 1914 was the lowest year for subscriptions with £33<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and 1916 the highest at £63.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The years during the First World War were subject to inflation, but the difference between the two amounts is very substantial. It is possible that a regular advertisement about the work of the Home that ran in the <em>Church Chronicle</em> from September 1913 to November 1915 raised awareness of it and encouraged subscriptions. The war economy may also have had an effect, with more job security and higher wages leading people to feel they could pledge money.</p>
<p>Although no accounts exist for 1918, the Annual Report mentioned the Home had gained many new subscribers.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Yet in 1921 the subscriptions were £64,<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> suggesting that either subscribers were paying less per head or the numbers paying had not altered much. The Board may have seen subscribers as a way of insuring against the vagaries of donations, but they seemed to be just as prone to fluctuations.</p>
<p>Because of the income of the Home was inconsistent, large, one-off donations were important. These could take three forms. Occasionally someone would give a large amount of money, an established Trust might give a large amount annually, or someone would leave the Home a legacy. In the early years of the Home, legacies were not part of the income. This is probably because people tend to leave money to established organisations. The first recorded legacy was in 1916, when the Home was made the residual legatee of a will, but there is no record of how much money this brought in.<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The large, one-off amounts were more common and one features in the founding story of the Home. When the Board set up the Home, they took out a mortgage of £700. In November 1906 they wrote to Archdeacon Williams, a man with considerable private means, asking him for a low-interest loan. In reply, the Archdeacon promised to pay £200 off the mortgage if Palmerston North could raise £500. Within four weeks the money had been raised and the debt paid off.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The Home was mortgage free until 1908, when the Board bought the section next to the Home and extended the building. Once again this mortgage was largely paid off by one-off donations, a series of £100 grants from the T G Macarthy Trust, between 1914 and 1924 being used to make lump-sum payments.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Large, one-off donations were also invested to provide a more solid income for the Home. In 1916 the Home was gifted two amounts of £500 on the condition that they be invested in war bonds.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> These kinds of donations helped stabilise the finances of the Home by reducing, and eventually extinguishing, the mortgage, and by providing a more secure guaranteed income of investment interest.</p>
<p>During the early to mid 1920s the financial situation of the Home was very healthy. The first indication that the income was exceeding expenditure was in the 1918 Annual Report, which declared a surplus of £1 293.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> There are no financial records for 1918, so it is not possible to know why income had increased over expenses, but the amount was invested, providing further secure funds. Both 1921<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and 1922 were reported as being very good years, 1922 being the most profitable to date.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite increased expenditure, with the opening of the Foxton Home, surpluses continued. In 1927 the excess was £78,<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> somewhat smaller than 1918. Consistent financial records exist from 1926 and these show that donations began to drop during 1926, as reflected in the 1927 figures.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In early 1928 the Treasurer reported to the Board that there was a deficit of £164<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and in 1929 there was a deficit of £350.<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The accounts record an increase in donations for both 1929<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> and 1930,<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> but a general decrease in subscribers. The amount of subscriptions was static and decreased as a percentage of donations. 1930 reversed this trend, but this was most likely a result of a vigorous fundraising and subscriptions drive undertaken in 1929.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The public could not sustain the levels of donations during the depression and they dropped in 1931 to £413,<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> two thirds of the 1930 figure of £613.<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The lowest year for donations was 1933 when £281 was received.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The accounts of St Mary’s Homes in Karori showed that 1932 was also a low point for those homes with no subscriptions or donations in September and October.<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The 1931 Annual Report stopped distinguishing between subscriptions and free-will donations, only donations being shown. This could suggest that the subscription base was so low that it was not worth making a separate category for them. In the difficult financial times of the early 1930s it is probable that few people were willing to pledge money. The donations took some time to recover and it was not until 1948 that the record level set in 1926 was exceeded.</p>
<p>Parental contributions followed a similar pattern to donations during the 1920s. By 1921 the average amount paid by each parent was around twelve pounds<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and in 1926 fourteen pounds.<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> From this point the amount began dropping. At the 1928 Annual General Meeting a £100 loss of parent funding was reported.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The average amount was hovering at around eleven pounds until 1931 when it decreased to eight pounds.<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> It rose again in 1932 to eleven pounds and then settled to be an average of nine pounds per child for the rest of the 1930s.</p>
<p>Given the economic decline that New Zealand was experiencing in the late 1920s, it is not surprising that parents were having difficutly meeting their obligations to the Home. What is interesting is that the contributions seem to have gone down so quickly and then risen again. The parents entered into a contract when they placed their children at the Home, so the Board could use legal means to make them pay. The payment, or non-payment, of parental contributions is dealt with in more detail in Chapter [ParentalAgency], but defaulting parents had implications for the finances of the Home. Enforcing the legal obligations that parents were under was an easy way of increasing the amount of money the Home received.</p>
<p>Another factor could have been the decision to close the Foxton Home, which was made by the Trustees in 1931.<a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> To facilitate the merger into the Palmerston North Home, the number of children under the Board’s care had to decrease by around thirty. The Trustees had to decide which children to remove and it is probable that those parents who were in arrears were asked to take their children away. Added to this was the Board’s decision to curtail expenses by restricting the number of new children.<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> A more careful admission policy may have resulted in the Home not taking in any children whose parents could not pay. These policies would have led to the amount of parental contributions being sustained rather than dropping.</p>
<p>In the straightened financial times of the late 1920s and 1930s, the large one-off donations became even more important. In particular, the continued grants from the T.G. Macarthy Trust sustained the Home: in 1932 and 1933 the amounts received from the Trust were almost as much as donations.<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> In 1935, the Annual Report stated that the finances of the Home were improving, but only due to the £150 grant from the Macarthy Trust and a legacy of £200.<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>That financial year the Home also received its largest ever one-off donation, £2 000 from W. Reed. This was given to the Home for the purpose of reducing the mortgage the Board had taken out to build the new Home in Pascal Street. This gift, along with the sale of some investments, enabled the Board to pay off the mortgage, which helped the financial situation.<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Another type of legacy also helped the Home during this period. Sometime in the early 1930s the Home was left income by at least two estates. These first appear in the 1933 accounts and, although the amounts are small and variable, they came to around £60 per year. In 1935 T.R. Moore left the Home a £1 a week.<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> This guaranteed income became increasingly important to the Home and by 1939 the grant from the Macarthy Trust, combined with the income from the estates, was almost twice the amount donated.<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> This shows that the Home was becoming reliant on legacies, a pattern that continued into the the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>During the Second World War the Home’s finances were on a sound footing, with income exceeding expenses in some years.<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> This enabled the Board to invest money for the Home which would become important in the 1950s. The first signs that the Home might be heading into a prolonged period of financial difficulty was in 1945, when a deficit of £301 was reported. This generated considerable discussion at the Annual General Meeting. It was believed that war conditions were somewhat to blame, as gifts were not so plentiful due to rationing.<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>When the war ended, the Home still found its expenses exceeding its income, and the deficits increased, with the loss in 1950 being £1 163.<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> This trend began to reverse in 1951 and 1952, but again in 1953 the deficit was over £1 000. Between 1945 and 1964 in only one year, 1960, did the Home receive more than it spent. This is probably a reflection of the rise of the cost of living during the 1950s, but it is also of generally decreasing donations. They reached a post-depression low in 1949, with £216 recorded.</p>
<p>Donations rose during the early 1950s, peaking in 1954 due to two one-off fundraising efforts. The Massey Students’ Association donated the funds from their capping day collection and C.M. Ross and Co charged those who wished to see the scene of the Royal Dinner from the Queen’s visit in 1953, and gave the proceeds to the Home.<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> 1955 and 1956 were also reasonable years for donations, but this can be explained by the extra efforts to publicise the Home at the time of its 50th jubilee year in 1956. Even with these increases, the level of donations did not reach much above those of the mid-to-late-1930s.</p>
<p>This decrease in donations became a serious problem as the Home struggled to balance its books. It is difficult to know why it became harder for the Home to solicit donations. However, it is possible that the introduction of a comprehensive social security system meant that charities which provided welfare services found it more difficult to present their cause as a pressing need.<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In Chapter 9 there is further discussion about how public views of institutions were changing and this too could have effected donation levels<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As donations decreased, legacies became a much more influential form of income. The importance of these large one-off donations is mentioned in eight Annual Reports from 1951 to 1962. It was these amounts, coupled with those invested, that prevented the Home from become indebted due to its deficits. At the 1952 Annual General Meeting the Treasurer reported that in the last twelve years the Home had received £7716 in bequests and its losses were £4 480, which meant that accumulated funds had grown in spite of the continued working deficits.<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1951 the Home was left a farm in trust, and an income of about £100-£150 was expected.<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> By 1961 this legacy was giving the Home £250 per year.<a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Bequests that paid regular amounts were important because the Home could use them as a reliable source of income, but the amount the Home received in one-off bequests increased as well. In 1955 bequests amounted to £649, almost equal to the donations,<a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and in 1959 bequests were £3 654, almost ten times donations.<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Between 1959 and 1964 the Home was left a total of £11 588 and had become reliant on these legacies to make ends meet.<a href="#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The growing number of legacies is probably a reflection of the age of the Home, with some of the money being from long-time supporters and ex-committee members. However, it is also a reflection of the place that children’s homes held in the minds of the older members of the Palmerston North community. The amount received from donations was dropping, yet those who would have been young when the Home opened were bequeathing sometimes significant sums of money to it.</p>
<p>During 1952 and 1953 there was considerable discussion with the Ladies’ Committee and Board about the compliance of parents. One theme that began to emerge was that some parents were having difficulty meeting the amount required, which was stated as being one pound per week per child.<a href="#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Figures from the 1950s show that most parents were not paying the full amount. In 1948 the shortfall between the full amount parents should have paid and what they did was pay was nineteen pounds per child, in 1961 the shortfall was £30.<a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> From this we can see that during the 1950s there was an increasing trend for parents not to pay maintenance. We can not know the individual circumstances of each family but it is possible that the introduction of government funded social services had led to a feeling among parents that they did not need to pay for their children.</p>
<p>This could feeling may have been compounded by the fact that the Government paid family benefit directly to the Home. From 1946 the Home was entitled to receive ten shillings per week for each child in their care This money quickly became the largest, constant income source for the Home (Figure [Income]). The income from the family benefit did fluctuate depending on how many children were in the Home, but its general trend was upwards, and in most years it was more, and sometimes significantly more, than free-will donations. For example in the 1957 Annual Report donations were £586 and government payments £941.<a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1957 the Government introduced a new type of payment for children’s homes, called capitation. It was designed to assist toward capital expenditure and reduce the reliance on public and private donations.<a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> It is possible that the Government was recognising that children’s homes could no longer run on the vagaries of donations and maintain the standard required by the Child Welfare Department.</p>
<p>The Home received around £1000 per year in government payments in 1947 rising to almost £1 800 in the early 1960s. However, despite this boost in income, it remained in prolonged deficit. This suggests that Home was not receiving anywhere near enough donations and parental contributions to keep running. The relationship between the Home and government is examined in more detail in Chapter [RelationshipHomeGovernment], but it seems that government payments were part of the reason the the Home was able to remain open when other income streams were dropping.</p>
<p>The monetary income the Home received only tells part of the story of donations. Over the years the Home was open it relied very heavily on donations in kind. Right from the opening of the first Home, the Palmerston North community gave many goods to it. When the Home opened on 18 October 1906, a ‘furnishing tea’ was held. The <em>Manawatu Standard</em> reported: ‘Yesterday morning, before the function, the house was practically empty, but by the time the gathering was over it was supplied, and more than supplied, with every conceivable thing’.<a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The Home also received free bread and meat<a href="#fn70" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> and its needs were made public by letters to the newspaper asking for goods like winter clothes.<a href="#fn71" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> When the first Home was extended in 1908, the public was asked to provide beds and bedding.<a href="#fn72" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>It became common practice to publish the donation of goods the Home received each month in the newspaper. In February 1918 clothing was a common donation, as was food, including that left over from events, like picnics.<a href="#fn73" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> In April 1924 a similar pattern is seen, but the variety is greater, including a bed, crockery, sweets and comics.<a href="#fn74" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> A list from 1938 shows the gifts were mainly food, although hair cutting and firewood were listed.<a href="#fn75" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> By the 1950s the monthly list of gifts had shrunk: in May 1958 fifteen donors were listed<a href="#fn76" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> compared with fifty-two in 1924<a href="#fn77" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a>. The items donated in 1958 included clothing and toys, but mostly they were made up of left-over cakes and sandwiches from various events. It seems that the public were donating less goods to the Home and what was being donated was more likely to be left-over cakes and sandwich than household items and groceries.</p>
<p>Gifts were very important to the Home as they reduced the amount of goods it needed to buy. The drop in the donations of goods experienced during the 1950s may be part of the reason that expenses rose. As has already been discussed, the Home spent more than it earned from 1945 until its closure. During the early 1950s one of the Board members, P.B. Davidson, began canvasing for goods for the Home. At the 1952 Annual General Meeting, he offered to approach city firms for gifts in kind such as blankets, linen and footwear.<a href="#fn78" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> He continued this scheme for some years and it was credited with improving the Home’s finances in 1954, when the deficit was only £60.<a href="#fn79" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> In December 1954 Davidson warned that he might have difficulty in keeping up his scheme.<a href="#fn80" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Although it is mentioned in the 1956 and 1957 Annual Reports,<a href="#fn81" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> it seems to have slowly decreased.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts to increase donations of goods, it is noticeable from the Ladies’ Committee Minutes that the amount that Matron had to purchase increased. Clothes seemed to be a particular issue, with the Matron regularly requesting that she be allowed to buy items and being told by the Ladies’ Committee that she was not allowed to purchase clothing or shoes without permission.<a href="#fn82" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> It also seems that there was some difficulty in matching the needs with the donations,<a href="#fn83" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> and at one stage donated clothing that was too big was given away.<a href="#fn84" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>The grocery bill also came under a great deal of scrutiny in the mid-1950s, and the Ladies’ Committee decided that they needed to deal with a wholesale grocer.<a href="#fn85" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> This suggests that the amount of food that the Home needed to buy was increasing because there were not as many donations of food being received. It appears that the gifts the Home received reduced in the 1950s and this partially explains why expenses increased.</p>
<p>As with many charities, the Home ran and was the beneficiary of fundraising events. Sometimes these could make a difference in the financial situation of the Home, as they did in 1954, but mostly they supplemented donations or facilitated gifts in kind. Some of the early fundraisers included sales of work,<a href="#fn86" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> bazaars<a href="#fn87" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a>and concerts.<a href="#fn88" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> In 1920 £100 was raised by two members of the Ladies’ Committee who organised an entertainment, accounting for almost one third of donations that year.<a href="#fn89" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Records of jumble sales first appeared in 1935 earning £7.<a href="#fn90" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Although jumble sales were a popular fundraiser in the late 1940s and early 1950s, they rarely raised significant sums: £19 in 1952<a href="#fn91" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> and £34 in 1956.<a href="#fn92" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> A more profitable fundraiser became available to the Home in the early 1950s when the Jaycees began an annual market day. The first stall, which was held in 1951, raised £84, accounting for almost one quarter of donations received that year.<a href="#fn93" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> By the late 1950s the market day was making a substantial contribution to donations, raising £177 in 1958, approximately one third of donations.<a href="#fn94" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> As free-will donations dropped off, fundraisers became a much more important way of securing donations for the Home.</p>
<p>The most important annual fundraiser for the the Home was the birthday party. It was celebrated from 1907 and was not only the main fundraising event for the year but also served as a way of publicising the work of the Home. This way of raising funds seems to have been common among children’s homes, with the other home in Palmerston North, Willard Home, also running a birthday party and Howe and Swain also found that Birthday Parties were a main fundraiser for the Melbourne Home they studied.<a href="#fn95" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The general format of the Birthday Party was that the Vicar would write a letter to local newspapers inviting members of the public to the party and asking them to bring a gift, with suggestions for gifts listed in the letter. The parties themselves were important affairs, with invited dignitaries, like the local Member of Parliament and the Mayor. Not only did the parties provide an opportunity to receive gifts, but they also enabled the public to visit the Home as it was open on the day of the party. A long list of gifts received in 1923 highlights the importance of the annual event. Twenty-six people gave cash; sugar, eggs and jam were popular gifts; and the Home was also given grass clippers and gramophone records.<a href="#fn96" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The list from the 1930 birthday party is also long, with fewer cash donations, seventeen, but still many gifts in kind, including fifty cases of oranges.<a href="#fn97" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>By the early 1950s the strain of running the Birthday Party was showing with the Ladies’ Committee postponing the 1953 party until early 1954, due to lack of help.<a href="#fn98" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> In 1954 and 1955 the party was held in March, a departure from the traditional late October or early November date. In 1956 the November date was reverted to as part of the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Home.<a href="#fn99" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Subsequently, a birthday party was not held again until 1959 and at the Annual General Meeting in 1960 one of the topics discussed was whether to hold the birthday party again, as the one held March 1960 had received only average gifts.<a href="#fn100" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> It appears that what had once been a reliable way of raising funds, gifts and publicising the work of the Home was no longer effective and this fits with the general pattern of donations and public interest declining from the 1950s onwards.</p>
<p>Ensuring the financial viability of the All Saints’ Children’s Home was never easy. Like many charities the Home had years where its income well exceeded its expenses and some years where the reverse was true. In the initial years the Home struggled financially, being a new institution without an established public reputation. However, from the end of World War One to the depression the Home was fortunate to receive good public support, both from monetary donations and gifts in kind. The depression was difficult for the Home but it managed through large one-off donations. There was little drop in parental contributions and it appears gifts in kind continued. By the end of World War Two legacies and surpluses had enabled the Home to invest money, which helped it survive the decline in donations that occurred during the 1950s. The Home found it very difficult to fund the growing expenses after World War Two and was in deficit for all but one year between 1945 and 1964. There was a drop in donations, both of money and gifts, as well as a decrease in parental contributions. This was somewhat off set by the newly available government benefits, but despite this providing a significant increase in funds the Home still ran at a loss, suggesting that these funds played a role in keeping the Home open. It was only legacies and the past investment of surpluses that prevented the Home from becoming indebted due to constant shortfall in funds. During the 1950s there were efforts to increase the donation of gifts in kind and fundraising efforts, but these were unable to compensate for increased costs and dropping donations. As the Home aged, it became dependant on legacies, suggesting that those who had been young when the Home first open still thought of it as a worthy cause to give money to.</p>
