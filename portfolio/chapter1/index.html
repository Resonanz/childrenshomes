         <h1>Chapter 1: The Opening of the Home</h1>
         <p><em>‘With unlimited faith and enthusiasm’<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></em>
<p>Many institutions have founding stories and All Saints’ Children’s Home is no exception. Reflecting in 1927 on the impulse that led him to open a children’s home, Canon Harper<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> said, ‘In 1906, I had undertaken to find a home for an orphan boy who had been in hospital for a long while. As our Homes in other parts of New Zealand were full, the idea occurred to me to ask the Parish to provide one.’<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The fact that Canon Harper saw a children’s home as a solution to the problem before him shows that he was in tune with what was considered best for children who were orphaned or destitute at the beginning of the twentieth century. Across the western world there was a movement towards viewing children as particularly valuable, needing separate and specialised care. Within this there was also a shift to see children as being not only owned by their families but also as an asset to the country, a public interest rather than just a private one. In New Zealand the contemporary debate focused on the environment in which parentless children were raised, particularly the need to separate those children who were indigent from those considered criminal. By 1906 the industrial school system and private boarding had come under sustained criticism, the former because it placed criminal and indigent children together, the latter because it was believed children were exploited by the families that boarded them. This space was increasingly filled by voluntary organisations opening children’s homes. Churches were particularly active in this area, shifting the focus of their social work away from unmarried mothers to children.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The demand for this new service was illustrated when applications quickly out stripped the number of beds in the Home. It has been argued that churches’ expanding work with children had denominational overtones<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and there was certainly some concern from churches about the need to raise parentless children in the faith of their forebears. However, in New Zealand the primary rationale for children’s homes was similar to that in other western nations in that they were seen as a way of turning potential problem children into good citizens. The fact that the All Saints’ congregation approved and supported the opening of a children’s home, with a creche attached, shows the extent to which provincial New Zealand was abreast of contemporary child welfare issues in the West.</p>
<p>The transformation of the way children were viewed during the nineteenth century is well documented. McDonald labels the change as a move from seeing the child as a chattel to the child becoming social capital.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The idea that children were no longer a private good, but instead something that the community and nation needed to care for as potential citizens is often linked to the declining birth rate in western countries.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> There were fears of ‘race suicide’, as the number of white children being born decreased, and there was a desire to be socially efficient, making sure all children born became useful citizens.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In New Zealand improving the environmental factors in which children were raised was seen as the way to turn children into good citizens.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This can be observed in contemporary discussion, which emphasised the conditions in which children were raised,<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and these ideas influenced government social policy as well as ordinary citizens. The fact that Harper was concerned about the future of a crippled child in hospital shows the influence of such ideas. A hospital was not considered a wholesome environment in which to raise a future citizen, particularly as at the time hospitals were mostly places for residential care of the elderly.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The perception that environment had a large influence on whether a child became a good citizen meant that increased attention was directed to those children whose parents were unable to care for them.</p>
<p>The problem posed by deserted, destitute, or neglected children was as old as European settlement in New Zealand. The terms used to describe these children were sometimes used interchangeably, but generally they referred to children whose parents or guardians were not caring for them in what was considered an appropriate manner. These children often came to the attention of the State and the industrial school system was formulated as a cure for this problem. However, there were parents that did not always come to the attention of the State, yet were unable to care for their children. Rather than being neglectful parents they had suffered some trauma, for example illegitimacy, family breakdown, divorce, separation, desertion, or the death of one parent. In a world without welfare payments, solo parents found themselves needing to work to support their children, yet it was difficult to find childcare for them, unless immediate family was prepared to help. One important factor marked the kind of care sought by these parents: it needed to be flexible enough that they could reclaim their children if their circumstances changed. The industrial school was not intended for children from these families, it was meant for those children who were in moral or physical danger,<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> plus it was not flexible. Once children entered an industrial school they were wards of the state. Hence a network of different kinds of care developed for these families and children.</p>
<p>If a parent or family found the care of a child had become difficult, they had several options. Charitable Aid Boards could grant a family outdoor relief. Most often this was only available to widows and deserted wives.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Deserted and widowed husbands appear to have had very few options, and little is known about how they managed if they had no family support, although it is possible that they paid for childcare through private arrangements. Divorced or separated parents and unmarried mothers also had very few options due to societal disapproval. There was a small number of church-run and charitable-aid orphanages, but these had mixed reputation, and often dealt with large numbers.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 1895 New Zealand was gripped by the events in Winton when Minnie Dean, a ‘baby farmer’, was arrested for the murder of three of her charges.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Generally, children sent to baby farmers were illegitimate, but baby farmers were part of network of care options for parents unable to care for their children.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The effect of the Dean case and similar exposés<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> was to discredit the care of children by unrelated women in their own homes. Increasingly such activities were regulated by Infant Life Protection Acts,<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> making it much more difficult for people to provide casual care.</p>
<p>It was not only the private arrangements made for children that came under strong criticism at the beginning of the twentieth century. The government system of industrial schools was also under increasing attack. In 1900 a scandal broke after members of the Nelson Charitable Aid Board paid a surprise visit to the the Marist-run St Mary’s Orphanage in Stoke. Although this was a privately-run home, it was licensed as an industrial school and received state funds.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The subsequent government inquiry led to a change in the law which forced private industrial schools to provide the same conditions as state industrial schools. The <em>Manawatu Evening Standard</em> was particularly exercised by the inquiry. It ran three editorials on industrial schools in October and November 1900.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> They were all against the present system, the general tone being encapsulated a the 24 October editorial which stated ‘we unhesitatingly pronounce in favour of what is known as the “Scattered Cottage Home System.”’<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>There were subsequent government enquires into the Burnham Industrial School in 1906 and Te Oranga in 1908.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Both of these institutions acted as reformatories, for boys and girls respectively. The <em>Manawatu Evening Standard</em> had previously been critical of both institutions.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Another enquiry in 1906, which was well reported locally examined the Waltham Orphanage, which was controlled by the North Canterbury Charitable Aid Board.<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This enquiry provoked an editorial entitled ‘Dependent Children’ in which the editor condemned institutions and praised cottage homes.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> From the coverage in the press it appears that the welfare of dependant children and the problems with industrial schools were well canvased in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>A criticism that was often levelled at industrial schools was that they did not distinguish between children who were committed because they were neglected and children who had ‘criminal tendencies’. In May 1904 the <em>Manawatu Evening Standard</em> ran an editorial about a recently released report on industrial schools. It highlighted what it believed to be a serious problem: ‘youthful lawbreakers were either thrown into contact with children untainted with crime and free from criminal instincts or sent to prison to associate with hardened criminals’.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 1899 George Hogben had been appointed Director-General of Schools. He was aware that industrial schools placed all types of children together and began to reform the system.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He believed that boarding out was the best system for children who were committed for non-criminal reasons, going as far as to declare in 1900 that ‘for the orphanage we have substituted the boarding out system. These are for those who are orphans or simply destitute without any other abnormal characteristics.’<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Hogben believed that boarding out would prevent destitute children from becoming institutionalised. By being in a ‘natural’ setting, these children could learn the habits of decent family life.</p>
<p>Although this scheme sounded like a robust solution to the problem of orphans or destitution, by 1905 it was also coming under attack. The anti-boarding out movement had its nucleus in Christchurch, but its ideas were well publicised and debated.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The main argument was that the foster families were of a low standard and this placed already vulnerable children at further risk.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The solution offered was cottage homes. The idea of cottage homes was well canvased in the Palmerston North press,<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and the local MP made the State provision of cottage homes part of his election campaign in 1905.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>These threads provide the background to the decision that the All Saints’ Vestry made in 1906. When faced with the problem of an orphan child, they chose to open a cottage-style children’s home rather than place him with the State. There was obviously a belief among those associated with the church that the existing options available to them were less than satisfactory. They may have been prompted by an active Vicar and an immediate case before them, but the fact that they went to the effort to set up a Home suggests that they saw a need within the community. The choice of the word ‘Home’ rather than ‘Orphanage’ also suggests that they wished to distance themselves from the idea of an institution.</p>
<p>The Trust first met on 3 October 1906<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and purchased a house that was capable of accommodating nine children.<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Within a month they had three children. By the end of 1906 they had seven and by March 1907, five months after opening, they had nine.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In May 1907 the board added another room, meaning that the Home could accommodate eight girls and seven boys.<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> A newspaper report celebrating the first anniversary of the Home stated that there were fourteen children in the Home and that over the year thirty-five applications had been refused due to lack of space.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Work had already begun to expand the numbers of children the Home could take. During 1907 the Board discussed whether to enlarge the current building, or to construct a new building. They looked at land, talked to land agents and placed an advertisement in the press offering to exchange the present property for a ‘larger section, vacant or otherwise’.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> By March 1908 the Board had acquired the house and section adjacent to the current Home and settled on a plan to enlarge the house they already owned.<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The new wing was opened on 28 August 1908 by Lady Plunket and the extension allowed the Home to accommodate twenty-five children.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> By August 1909 the number of children in the Home stood at twenty-one.<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Within less than three years Palmerston North had gone from having no private provision for orphan and destitute children to having a Home that accommodated twenty-five or more. The rapid growth speaks of a need for the type of service it offered.</p>
<p>The opening and rapid expansion of the All Saints’ Children’s Home was not an isolated event, as throughout New Zealand churches were becoming more involved in this kind of social work. Churches had engaged in work with orphans in an ad hoc manner in the nineteenth century. The Christchurch Anglican Diocese had run an orphanage in conjunction with the provincial government from 1862 to 1879, when the children were removed to an orphanage in Lyttelton, run solely by the Provincial Government.<a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Nelson Anglicans had been active in providing for destitute children with an orphanage in Motueka and one in Nelson, which was a joint effort with the Presbyterian Church.<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The Auckland Diocese had run various types of homes for children from 1858, opening a large orphanage in Parnell in 1862.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Along with two Catholic institutions, this was run as a private industrial school and therefore received government funding.<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> There were other organisations running children’s home and orphanages in the 1900s, but the presence of church denominations was becoming much more noticeable. In 1913 seventeen children’s homes and orphanages were listed in the <em>Statistics of New Zealand,</em> thirteen of them run by churches<em>.</em><a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> This list is not complete, as there were at least another two not listed.<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The number of churches becoming involved in operating children’s homes is quite marked in the years leading up to World War One, placing the opening of the All Saints’ Children’s Home squarely within a wider church movement.</p>
<p>The focus by churches on child welfare and particularly the shift to opening children’s homes has been noted by other historians. Tennant identified that churches which worked with unmarried mothers began to undergo a change of focus between the 1880s and the early 1900s. As they received more cases of second or multiple ‘falls’, the churches began to shift away from trying to reform the mother to caring for the children.<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The Anglican Church in Tasmania began working with children when they opened a home for the babies born in their maternity home for unmarried mothers. They quickly found that it was much easier to raise funds for innocent babies than for women whose morals were questionable and whose activities were not talked about in polite society.<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>One explanation offered as to why churches began children’s home is increased denominationalism. Tennant argues that part of churches’ motivation was to ensure that children born into their denomination were raised in it.<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> This was certainly true of the Catholic Orphanages and is shown by the reluctance of Catholic Homes to board out children as they could not find enough Catholic foster parents.<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The motives of Protestants were possibly less denominational. The All Saints’ Home was, from the beginning, entirely non-denominational and the fact that it was open to all children regardless of denomination was often emphasised.<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> In Napier, Wanganui and Nelson the main children’s homes were non-denominational and the second children’s home opened in Palmerston North was also non-denominational.<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Presumably it was easier for the Anglicans, in particular, to be less concerned about which church children were being brought up in as they were the dominant denomination in New Zealand and one of the main operator of children’s home, caring for 896 children in 1925.<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> There was a thread of denominationalism in the motivation of churches’ work with children, but the fact that so many homes, including All Saints’, went out of their way to affirm that they would take all children suggests that it was not the prime catalyst.</p>
<p>Another explanation as to why churches became involved in running children’s homes was the belief that rescuing the child from its surroundings could correct moral deficiency. This so-called child rescue was also based on the idea that environment was the main corrupter of children, a concept that was popular in New Zealand. The movement focused on the removal of the child from poor, inadequate living conditions and vicious influences. The child, once rescued, would be placed in a home with Christian or otherwise wholesome moral influences, often in a rural setting, or even removed to another country via child immigration.<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The most famous child rescuer was Dr Barnardo, and his ideas were spread widely throughout the western world via his clever publicity.<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The neglect of children was used as a reason for starting children’s homes, even though New Zealand lacked large cities like London, Toronto or Melbourne, where neglected and destitute children were actively removed from the streets. The Hawke’s Bay Children’s Home was begun by women who had become increasingly concerned about girls roaming the streets of Napier.<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In Auckland the Anglican nuns, the Order of the Good Shepherd, set up a home in 1902, with the expressed desire to care for the neglected and battered children of the city.<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>There [ch1:ChildRescue]is also some reference to rescue as a motivation for the establishment of the All Saints’ Children’s Home. In the All Saints’ Parish Magazine of December 1906, the update on the Home stated that ‘One of these (inmates) was rescued from undesirable surroundings by the police’.<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Much was made of the moral opportunities the Home offered to those ‘little ones who through no fault of their own, were unable to obtain these good things elsewhere’.<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> In 1911 a article in the <em>Church Chronicle</em> about social work in the Wellington Anglican Diocese told readers ‘Those who know the slum life of Wellington can bring numbers of cases forward where boys and girls are being bought up in surroundings so bad that there is little hope of true physical or moral or spiritual development.’<a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> There is little evidence that children were actively sought and removed from families as they were in other countries,<a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> but New Zealanders were familiar with the basic ideas of child rescue. Churches are affected by streams of thought in society and although the child-rescue discourse may not have been very strong in New Zealand, there is evidence that the core ideas about the importance of removing a child from a corrupting environment had an influence on the course of church social work.</p>
<p>When All Saints’ Children’s Home opened in 1906, it was an innovative response to the problem at hand, being the first children’s home in the Wellington Anglican Diocese.<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The fact that there was a creche attached to the Home also shows that Palmerston North was abreast of modern ideas in child welfare and was not afraid to try a solution that is best described as controversial. Creches had been opened in other New Zealand towns and the first successful, long-term creche was in Wellington, opened by Mother Aubert in 1903.<a href="#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Within the community there was still ambivalence towards day care. There was recognition that some parents were forced into work through their circumstances and it was better for a child to be cared for in a safe, wholesome environment, like a church-run creche, rather than left at home alone or taken to the parent’s place of work. However, at a time when the cult of motherhood was growing, there was also concern that parents, particularly mothers, would use a creche to shirk their duties as parents.<a href="#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> When the creche was set up, the Board was very clear that children would only be admitted when the available parent genuinely had to work.<a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The 1907 annual report stated that the creche was in constant use.<a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> At the Annual General Meeting it was noted that the care of the young children in the creche placed a great strain on the Matron and employing an assistant was discussed as well as asking for voluntary help.<a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Although there is no formal record of the creche closing, it is noted in the Matron’s scrapbook that it closed in July 1907.<a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Why this occurred is not known but it did coincide with a change in Matron.<a href="#fn70" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The creche may have been a short-lived innovation but the fact that All Saints’ were prepared to provide a service about which there was some suspicion in the community shows that they were very interested in child welfare and not afraid to provide controversial services.</p>
<p>In 1910 Rev. Harper left All Saints’ to become Vicar of St Peters, Wellington. In October he attended the celebrations of the fourth anniversary of the Home and was presented with a framed photo of himself with the children. Harper reflected that the Home had begun in a small way and had been enlarged twice and places were still in demand.<a href="#fn71" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The Home had filled a gap in the provision of child welfare in Palmerston North and surrounding areas. It provided a flexible alternative for parents who, for whatever reason, were unable to care for their children. The discrediting of the State system of care and progressive regulation of the casual, private arrangements for childcare meant that families were increasingly turning towards children’s homes as an alternative. This can be seen in the number that were opening in the period prior to World War One. The fact that churches became very involved in this form of welfare partly reflected a concern for raising destitute children in their parents’ denomination but there was also an element of child rescue involved. The All Saints’ Children’s Home was the first children’s home in the Anglican Diocese of Wellington and reflected an awareness among the parishioners of the contemporary trends in child welfare.</p>
