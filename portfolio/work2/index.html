<p><em>‘With unlimited faith and enthusiasm’[1]</em></p>

<p>Many institutions have founding stories and All Saints’ Children’s Home is no exception. Reflecting in 1927 on the impulse that led him to open a children’s home, Canon Harper[2] said, ‘In 1906, I had undertaken to find a home for an orphan boy who had been in hospital for a long while. As our Homes in other parts of New Zealand were full, the idea occurred to me to ask the Parish to provide one.’[3] The fact that Canon Harper saw a children’s home as a solution to the problem before him shows that he was in tune with what was considered best for children who were orphaned or destitute at the beginning of the twentieth century. Across the western world there was a movement towards viewing children as particularly valuable, needing separate and specialised care. Within this there was also a shift to see children as being not only owned by their families but also as an asset to the country, a public interest rather than just a private one. In New Zealand the contemporary debate focused on the environment in which parentless children were raised, particularly the need to separate those children who were indigent from those considered criminal. By 1906 the industrial school system and private boarding had come under sustained criticism, the former because it placed criminal and indigent children together, the latter because it was believed children were exploited by the families that boarded them. This space was increasingly filled by voluntary organisations opening children’s homes. Churches were particularly active in this area, shifting the focus of their social work away from unmarried mothers to children.[4] The demand for this new service was illustrated when applications quickly out stripped the number of beds in the Home. It has been argued that churches’ expanding work with children had denominational overtones[5] and there was certainly some concern from churches about the need to raise parentless children in the faith of their forebears. However, in New Zealand the primary rationale for children’s homes was similar to that in other western nations in that they were seen as a way of turning potential</p>
